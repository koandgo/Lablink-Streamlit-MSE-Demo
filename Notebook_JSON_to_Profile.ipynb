Using density functional theory (DFT), we show that a low energy of formation, exacerbated in the presence of humidity, explains the propensity of perovskites to decompose back into their precursors. We find, also using DFT, that intercalation of phenylethylammonium between perovskite layers introduces quantitatively appreciable van der Waals interactions. These drive an increased formation energy and should therefore improve material stability. Here we report reduced-dimensionality (quasi-2D) perovskite films that exhibit improved stability while retaining the high performance of conventional three-dimensional perovskites. Continuous tuning of the dimensionality, as assessed using photophysical studies, is achieved by the choice of stoichiometry in … ; View article Authors Jiang Tang, Kyle W Kemp, Sjoerd Hoogland, Kwang S Jeong, Huan Liu, Larissa Levina, Melissa Furukawa, Xihua Wang, Ratan Debnath, Dongkyu Cha, Kang Wei Chou, Armin Fischer, Aram Amassian, John B Asbury, Edward H Sargent Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Colloidal-quantum-dot (CQD) optoelectronics offer a compelling combination of solution processing and spectral tunability through quantum size effects. So far, CQD solar cells have relied on the use of organic ligands to passivate the surface of the semiconductor nanoparticles. Although inorganic metal chalcogenide ligands have led to record electronic transport parameters in CQD films, no photovoltaic device has been reported based on such compounds. Here we establish an atomic ligand strategy that makes use of monovalent halide anions to enhance electronic transport and successfully passivate surface defects in PbS CQD films. Both time-resolved infrared spectroscopy and transient device characterization indicate that the scheme leads to a shallower trap state distribution than the best organic ligands. Solar cells fabricated following this strategy show up to 6% solar AM1.5G power-conversion efficiency … ; View article Authors Derya Baran, Raja Shahid Ashraf, David A Hanifi, Maged Abdelsamie, Nicola Gasparini, Jason A Röhr, Sarah Holliday, Andrew Wadsworth, Sarah Lockett, Marios Neophytou, Christopher JM Emmott, Jenny Nelson, Christoph J Brabec, Aram Amassian, Alberto Salleo, Thomas Kirchartz, James R Durrant, Iain McCulloch Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Technological deployment of organic photovoltaic modules requires improvements in device light-conversion efficiency and stability while keeping material costs low. Here we demonstrate highly efficient and stable solar cells using a ternary approach, wherein two non-fullerene acceptors are combined with both a scalable and affordable donor polymer, poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT), and a high-efficiency, low-bandgap polymer in a single-layer bulk-heterojunction device. The addition of a strongly absorbing small molecule acceptor into a P3HT-based non-fullerene blend increases the device efficiency up to 7.7 ± 0.1% without any solvent additives. The improvement is assigned to changes in microstructure that reduce charge recombination and increase the photovoltage, and to improved light harvesting across the visible region. The stability of P3HT-based devices in ambient conditions is also significantly … ; View article Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films allow large-area solution processing and bandgap tuning through the quantum size effect,,,,,. However, the high ratio of surface area to volume makes CQD films prone to high trap state densities if surfaces are imperfectly passivated, promoting recombination of charge carriers that is detrimental to device performance. Recent advances have replaced the long insulating ligands that enable colloidal stability following synthesis with shorter organic linkers or halide anions,,,,, leading to improved passivation and higher packing densities. Although this substitution has been performed using solid-state ligand exchange, a solution-based approach is preferable because it enables increased control over the balance of charges on the surface of the quantum dot, which is essential for eliminating midgap trap states,. Furthermore, the solution-based approach leverages recent progress in … ; View article Authors Tianqi Niu, Jing Lu, Rahim Munir, Jianbo Li, Dounya Barrit, Xu Zhang, Hanlin Hu, Zhou Yang, Aram Amassian, Kui Zhao, Shengzhong Liu ; View article Authors Xu Zhang, Xiaodong Ren, Bin Liu, Rahim Munir, Xuejie Zhu, Dong Yang, Jianbo Li, Yucheng Liu, Detlef-M Smilgies, Ruipeng Li, Zhou Yang, Tianqi Niu, Xiuli Wang, Aram Amassian, Kui Zhao, Shengzhong Frank Liu Journal Energy & Environmental Science Publisher Royal Society of Chemistry Description Two-dimensional (2D) organic–inorganic perovskites have recently emerged as one of the most important thin-film solar cell materials owing to their excellent environmental stability. The remaining major pitfall is their relatively poor photovoltaic performance in contrast to 3D perovskites. In this work we demonstrate cesium cation (Cs+) doped 2D (BA)2(MA)3Pb4I13 perovskite solar cells giving a power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 13.7%, the highest among the reported 2D devices, with excellent humidity resistance. The enhanced efficiency from 12.3% (without Cs+) to 13.7% (with 5% Cs+) is attributed to perfectly controlled crystal orientation, an increased grain size of the 2D planes, superior surface quality, reduced trap-state density, enhanced charge-carrier mobility and charge-transfer kinetics. Surprisingly, it is found that the Cs+ doping yields superior stability for the 2D perovskite solar cells when … ; View article Authors Zhijun Ning, Oleksandr Voznyy, Jun Pan, Sjoerd Hoogland, Valerio Adinolfi, Jixian Xu, Min Li, Ahmad R Kirmani, Jon-Paul Sun, James Minor, Kyle W Kemp, Haopeng Dong, Lisa Rollny, André Labelle, Graham Carey, Brandon Sutherland, Ian Hill, Aram Amassian, Huan Liu, Jiang Tang, Osman M Bakr, Edward H Sargent Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) offer promise in flexible electronics, light sensing and energy conversion. These applications rely on rectifying junctions that require the creation of high-quality CQD solids that are controllably n-type (electron-rich) or p-type (hole-rich). Unfortunately, n-type semiconductors made using soft matter are notoriously prone to oxidation within minutes of air exposure. Here we report high-performance, air-stable n-type CQD solids. Using density functional theory we identify inorganic passivants that bind strongly to the CQD surface and repel oxidative attack. A materials processing strategy that wards off strong protic attack by polar solvents enabled the synthesis of an air-stable n-type PbS CQD solid. This material was used to build an air-processed inverted quantum junction device, which shows the highest current density from any CQD solar cell and a solar power conversion efficiency as … ; View article Authors Mengxia Liu, Oleksandr Voznyy, Randy Sabatini, F Pelayo García de Arquer, Rahim Munir, Ahmed Hesham Balawi, Xinzheng Lan, Fengjia Fan, Grant Walters, Ahmad R Kirmani, Sjoerd Hoogland, Frédéric Laquai, Aram Amassian, Edward H Sargent Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Bandtail states in disordered semiconductor materials result in losses in open-circuit voltage (Voc) and inhibit carrier transport in photovoltaics. For colloidal quantum dot (CQD) films that promise low-cost, large-area, air-stable photovoltaics, bandtails are determined by CQD synthetic polydispersity and inhomogeneous aggregation during the ligand-exchange process. Here we introduce a new method for the synthesis of solution-phase ligand-exchanged CQD inks that enable a flat energy landscape and an advantageously high packing density. In the solid state, these materials exhibit a sharper bandtail and reduced energy funnelling compared with the previous best CQD thin films for photovoltaics. Consequently, we demonstrate solar cells with higher Voc and more efficient charge injection into the electron acceptor, allowing the use of a closer-to-optimum bandgap to absorb more light. These enable the … ; View article Authors Derya Baran, Thomas Kirchartz, Scot Wheeler, Stoichko Dimitrov, Maged Abdelsamie, Jeffrey Gorman, Raja S Ashraf, Sarah Holliday, Andrew Wadsworth, Nicola Gasparini, Pascal Kaienburg, He Yan, Aram Amassian, Christoph J Brabec, James R Durrant, Iain McCulloch Journal Energy & environmental science Publisher Royal Society of Chemistry Description Optimization of the energy levels at the donor–acceptor interface of organic solar cells has driven their efficiencies to above 10%. However, further improvements towards efficiencies comparable with inorganic solar cells remain challenging because of high recombination losses, which empirically limit the open-circuit voltage (Voc) to typically less than 1 V. Here we show that this empirical limit can be overcome using non-fullerene acceptors blended with the low band gap polymer PffBT4T-2DT leading to efficiencies approaching 10% (9.95%). We achieve Voc up to 1.12 V, which corresponds to a loss of only Eg/q − Voc = 0.5 ± 0.01 V between the optical bandgap Eg of the polymer and Voc. This high Voc is shown to be associated with the achievement of remarkably low non-geminate and non-radiative recombination losses in these devices. Suppression of non-radiative recombination implies high external … ; View article Authors Koen Vandewal, Steve Albrecht, Eric T Hoke, Kenneth R Graham, Johannes Widmer, Jessica D Douglas, Marcel Schubert, William R Mateker, Jason T Bloking, George F Burkhard, Alan Sellinger, Jean MJ Fréchet, Aram Amassian, Moritz K Riede, Michael D McGehee, Dieter Neher, Alberto Salleo Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Interfaces between organic electron-donating (D) and electron-accepting (A) materials have the ability to generate charge carriers on illumination. Efficient organic solar cells require a high yield for this process, combined with a minimum of energy losses. Here, we investigate the role of the lowest energy emissive interfacial charge-transfer state (CT1) in the charge generation process. We measure the quantum yield and the electric field dependence of charge generation on excitation of the charge-transfer (CT) state manifold via weakly allowed, low-energy optical transitions. For a wide range of photovoltaic devices based on polymer:fullerene, small-molecule:C60 and polymer:polymer blends, our study reveals that the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) is essentially independent of whether or not D, A or CT states with an energy higher than that of CT1 are excited. The best materials systems show an IQE higher … ; View article Authors Jonathan A Bartelt, Zach M Beiley, Eric T Hoke, William R Mateker, Jessica D Douglas, Brian A Collins, John R Tumbleston, Kenneth R Graham, Aram Amassian, Harald Ade, Jean MJ Fréchet, Michael F Toney, Michael D McGehee Journal Advanced Energy Materials Description Most optimized donor‐acceptor (D‐A) polymer bulk heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells have active layers too thin to absorb greater than ∼80% of incident photons with energies above the polymer's band gap. If the thickness of these devices could be increased without sacrificing internal quantum efficiency, the device power conversion efficiency (PCE) could be significantly enhanced. We examine the device characteristics of BHJ solar cells based on poly(di(2‐ethylhexyloxy)benzo[1,2‐b:4,5‐b′]dithiophene‐co‐octylthieno[3,4‐c]pyrrole‐4,6‐dione) (PBDTTPD) and [6,6]‐phenyl‐C61‐butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) with 7.3% PCE and find that bimolecular recombination limits the active layer thickness of these devices. Thermal annealing does not mitigate these bimolecular recombination losses and drastically decreases the PCE of PBDTTPD BHJ solar cells. We characterize the morphology of these BHJs before … ; View article Authors Rafael Quintero-Bermudez, Aryeh Gold-Parker, Andrew H Proppe, Rahim Munir, Zhenyu Yang, Shana O Kelley, Aram Amassian, Michael F Toney, Edward H Sargent Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK ; View article Authors Christian B Nielsen, Alexander Giovannitti, Dan-Tiberiu Sbircea, Enrico Bandiello, Muhammad R Niazi, David A Hanifi, Michele Sessolo, Aram Amassian, George G Malliaras, Jonathan Rivnay, Iain McCulloch Journal Journal of the American Chemical Society Publisher American Chemical Society Description The organic electrochemical transistor (OECT), capable of transducing small ionic fluxes into electronic signals in an aqueous environment, is an ideal device to utilize in bioelectronic applications. Currently, most OECTs are fabricated with commercially available conducting poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT)-based suspensions and are therefore operated in depletion mode. Here, we present a series of semiconducting polymers designed to elucidate important structure–property guidelines required for accumulation mode OECT operation. We discuss key aspects relating to OECT performance such as ion and hole transport, electrochromic properties, operational voltage, and stability. The demonstration of our molecular design strategy is the fabrication of accumulation mode OECTs that clearly outperform state-of-the-art PEDOT-based devices, and show stability under aqueous operation without the need … ; View article Authors Weili Yu, Feng Li, Liyang Yu, Muhammad R Niazi, Yuting Zou, Daniel Corzo, Aniruddha Basu, Chun Ma, Sukumar Dey, Max L Tietze, Ulrich Buttner, Xianbin Wang, Zhihong Wang, Mohamed N Hedhili, Chunlei Guo, Tom Wu, Aram Amassian Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description The fields of photovoltaics, photodetection and light emission have seen tremendous activity in recent years with the advent of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Yet, there have been far fewer reports of perovskite-based field-effect transistors. The lateral and interfacial transport requirements of transistors make them particularly vulnerable to surface contamination and defects rife in polycrystalline films and bulk single crystals. Here, we demonstrate a spatially-confined inverse temperature crystallization strategy which synthesizes micrometre-thin single crystals of methylammonium lead halide perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with sub-nanometer surface roughness and very low surface contamination. These benefit the integration of MAPbX3 crystals into ambipolar transistors and yield record, room-temperature field-effect mobility up to 4.7 and 1.5 cm2 V−1 s−1 in p and n channel devices respectively … ; View article Authors Alexander Giovannitti, Christian B Nielsen, Dan-Tiberiu Sbircea, Sahika Inal, Mary Donahue, Muhammad R Niazi, David A Hanifi, Aram Amassian, George G Malliaras, Jonathan Rivnay, Iain McCulloch Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are receiving significant attention due to their ability to efficiently transduce biological signals. A major limitation of this technology is that only p-type materials have been reported, which precludes the development of complementary circuits, and limits sensor technologies. Here, we report the first ever n-type OECT, with relatively balanced ambipolar charge transport characteristics based on a polymer that supports both hole and electron transport along its backbone when doped through an aqueous electrolyte and in the presence of oxygen. This new semiconducting polymer is designed specifically to facilitate ion transport and promote electrochemical doping. Stability measurements in water show no degradation when tested for 2 h under continuous cycling.

A review of some of the most efficient polymers utilized in polymer:fullerene PV devices, combined with an analysis of reported polymer donor materials wherein the same conjugated backbone was used with varying alkyl substituents, supports this hypothesis. Specifically, the literature shows that higher-performing donor–acceptor type polymers generally have acceptor moieties that are sterically accessible for interactions with the fullerene derivative, whereas the corresponding donor moieties tend to have branched alkyl substituents that sterically hinder interactions with the fullerene. To further explore the idea that the most beneficial polymer:fullerene arrangement involves the fullerene docking with the acceptor moiety, a family of benzo[1,2-b … ; View article Authors So Min Park, Mingyang Wei, Nikolaos Lempesis, Wenjin Yu, Tareq Hossain, Lorenzo Agosta, Virginia Carnevali, Harindi R Atapattu, Peter Serles, Felix T Eickemeyer, Heejong Shin, Maral Vafaie, Deokjae Choi, Kasra Darabi, Eui Dae Jung, Yi Yang, Da Bin Kim, Shaik M Zakeeruddin, Bin Chen, Aram Amassian, Tobin Filleter, Mercouri G Kanatzidis, Kenneth R Graham, Lixin Xiao, Ursula Rothlisberger, Michael Grätzel, Edward H Sargent Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) promise enhanced operating stability compared to their normal-structure counterparts, –.

Here we develop a conformal self-assembled monolayer (SAM) as the hole-selective contact on light-managing textured substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations indicate that cluster formation during phosphonic acid adsorption leads to incomplete SAM coverage. We devise a co-adsorbent strategy that disassembles high-order clusters, thus homogenizing the distribution of phosphonic acid molecules, and thereby minimizing interfacial recombination and improving electronic structures.

However, as the field continues to seek ever-higher durability, additional tools that avoid progressive ligand intercalation are needed to minimize degradation at high temperatures. We used ammonium ligands that are nonreactive with the bulk of perovskites and investigated a library that varies ligand molecular structure systematically. We found that fluorinated aniliniums offer interfacial passivation and simultaneously minimize reactivity with perovskites. Using this approach, we report a certified quasi–steady-state power-conversion efficiency of 24.09% for inverted-structure PSCs.

However, unlike Si where parts per million dopant concentrations can significantly alter the conductivity, doping organic semiconductors with molecular dopants requires a much higher concentration (>5%), pointing to the fundamental bottlenecks in molecular doping of OSCs. Furthermore, the conductivity of doped OSCs deviates from the linear increase with doping concentration >20% (e.g., MeO-TPD doped with F4-TCNQ), or plateaus at low doping levels (e.g., 10% for P3HT doped with F4-TCNQ). This MURI team combines expertise in synthesis (You), characterization of materials (Ginger, So, Ade), novel device concepts and engineering (So), processing and morphological characterization (Amassian, Ade), computation (Li), robotic experimentation and ML data-analytics (Amassian, Ganapathysubramanian). This integrated team will address the fundamental questions outlined above, and explore novel photoredox dopant/switchable doping that can enable photopatterning of p and n doping to fabricate OSC integrated circuits. We will implement a collaborative workflow integrating robotic experimentation and machine learning (ML) to accelerate the pace of data generation, and co-design of dopant/polymers. REU SITE: Collaborative Research: Nanoscale Detectives -- Elucidating the Structure and Dynamics of Hybrid Perovskite Systems Date: 09/15/21 - 8/31/25 Amount: $162,000.00 Funding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF) Hybrid materials incorporating both organic and inorganic components are being engineered to create new materials in which targeted optical and electronic properties are encoded through the control of nanoscale composition/morphology. Hybrid perovskites are a particularly exciting class of materials that have been realized as high-performance solar cells, light-emitting diodes, lasers, photodetectors and transistors. The crystalline nature of this hybrid family enables organic/inorganic functionalities combining essential attributes from the two distinct realms of chemistry. With the realization of the new optoelectronic technologies and the influence of the nanoscopic structure on desired macroscopic properties, there is a need to fully connect the structure and dynamics of the systems at a molecular level. In the proposed REU program, students will extensively utilize instruments and cutting edge analytical tools housed within facilities of the NSF-funded Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN), which is one of 16 sites of the National Nanotechnology Coordinated Infrastructure (NNCI), and is a collaborative that partners North Carolina State University (NC State), the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH), and Duke University (Duke). Twelve undergraduate students annually will work in research labs at NC State, UNC, or Duke for 10 weeks during the summer. Through the collection and analysis of data, the students will elucidate new perspectives of hybrid perovskite systems and can directly apply this knowledge to the improvement of system designs and/or the investigation of novel applications. There are three objectives for this REU program: (1) To improve student knowledge of and provide hands-on experience for cutting-edge characterization techniques and analytical tools that can be used to evaluate hybrid perovskite systems; (2) to foster student interest in pursuing a career in STEM fields, especially those from underrepresented groups; and (3) to develop communication and networking skills in each of the participants.

TOSCA Thrust III: Pinpointing the Morphological and Chemical Origins of Degradation in Fullerene-free Organic Photovoltaics ONR White Paper Tracking Number: FY2019-000134-AS) Date: 04/01/20 - 8/31/24 Amount: $840,000.00 Funding Agencies: US Navy - Office Of Naval Research The aim of the proposed project is to identify and visualize the morphological and chemical origins of degradation in state-of-the-art organic photovoltaic (OPV) materials consisting of polymer donor and non-fullerene small-molecule acceptors (SMA). Specific objectives toward achieving this aim are as follows: (1) Visualize the multiphase morphology, associated heterointerfaces and energy landscape in modern bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs utilizing emerging spectromicroscopic imaging based on scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) approaches. (2) Interrogate the relative morphological stability of phases and heterointerfaces under thermal, light and environmental stresses and aging. (3) Detect changes in energetic landscape, morphology and chemical degradation associated to burn-in or long-term aging using cross-sectional STM on actual OPV devices. (4) Propose new materials design guidelines, materials combinations, BHJ morphologies, and processing schemes which achieve maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) while being thermodynamically and photochemically stable. Characterizing flexible OSC modules with high efficiency and lifetime Date: 07/01/21 - 4/30/24 Amount: $87,155.00 Funding Agencies: US Dept. of Defense (DOD) Base: The personnel at NCSU will provide complementary research to PolyPV LLC towards the goal of manufacturing flexible organic solar cell modules with high efficiency and lifetime. Specifically, multiple 1 cm2 cell that are to be connected into a module will be created by PolyPV LLC with scalable manufacturing methods such as blade-coating or slot-die printing. The subaward will characterize such devices for performance and stability and provide feedback to PolyPV LLC on how to improve the fabrication. NCSU will also provide benchmarking on devices produced by conventional spin-casting methods. Option: The type of characterization for the 6 month base-period and the 6 month option-period is essentially the same. The difference between these two periods is mostly in the devices produced by PolyPV LLC. We anticipate that during the 6 month option-period a new instrument that allows accelerated testing at high light intensity will become available. Spatially and Spectrally Resolved Semiconductor Single Crystal Arrays for Wafer-Scale Integrated Optoelectronics Date: 03/01/20 - 2/29/24 Amount: $495,284.00 Funding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF) This project aims to bridge the knowledge gap in the implementation of high-quality single crystal (SC) semiconductors into next-generation thin film-based electronic, optoelectronic and spintronic devices and their fabrication platforms. Specifically, we will focus on developing accelerated synthetic approaches which will enable SC growth on surfaces from a drying solution, their direct integration into electronic and optoelectronic devices, and ultimately the demonstration of wafer-scale SC device arrays. We will develop this in the context of hybrid metal halides (HMHs), an emerging salt-like class of semiconductors which have demonstrated remarkable semiconductor properties, ease of processing and a vast and yet unexplored chemical universe. Our approaches will enable the on-demand growth of semiconductor SCs with desired properties directly onto devices at designated locations using thin film deposition techniques, thus bringing about a paradigm shift in SC devices and ushering in a new era of accelerated co-design of SC materials and devices. Collaborative Research: Sustainable Ambient Printed High Efficiency Organic PhotoVoltaics (SAPHE-OPV) Date: 02/15/20 - 1/31/24 Amount: $302,244.00 Funding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF) The objective of the proposed research is to address the NSF program call for ����������������low-cost, environmentally benign organic photovoltaics��������������� by rationally developing high throughput ambient printing of novel high efficiency semi-conducting polymer:non-fullerene based solar cells with active layers processed with (a) petrochemical solvents such as anisole and o-methylanisole that are safer and more benign than currently used chlorinated solvents, and (b) renewable, green solvents such as ethanol and possibly even water. The molecular design needed will be guided by fundamental molecular interaction considerations and detailed structure-solvent-morphology relations. Controlling Stress and Strain in Perovskite Solar Cells to Enhance Efficiency and Stability Date: 06/08/20 - 6/07/23 Amount: $450,000.00 Funding Agencies: US Navy - Office Of Naval Research In this white paper we describe some of the fundamental questions that need to be answered in order to enable the fabrication of exceptionally stable tandems with greater than 30% efficiency. We will study perovskites with low, medium and high bandgaps. We have chosen to emphasize controlling stress and strain in perovskites because only a few manuscripts have been published on the subject despite the enormous importance it has been shown to have in the development of other thin-film electronic and optoelectronic devices. What causes strain buildup in solution-processed perovskite films must be understood at a fundamental level in order to develop stress mitigation strategies that are portable across materials (e.g., different bandgaps), processes (e.g., one-step vs two-step) and from lab-to-fab (e.g., spin-coating vs blade-coating). The need to control stress and strain is multiplied when dealing with tandem devices, which involve many more layers than a single junction device and two or more perovskite layers. We are also seeking to have a better understanding of what determines the density of halogen vacancies, since they are charged mobile defects that can both change the electric field in the device, trap charge and enhance recombination. It is very likely that stress and strain affect the density of vacancies RAPID: Defect-Chemistry Design of Titanium Dioxide for Enhanced Virucidal Photodynamic Properties Date: 06/15/20 - 5/31/22 Amount: $174,598.00 Funding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF) The proposed research program leverages expertise of an interdisciplinary group of scientists to develop fundamental synthesis-structure-property-function relationships for metal oxide nanomaterials for efficacy in inactivating surrogate viruses for COVID-19.

Researchers developed a new method which visualizes interfaces where the sunlight’s energy is converted to electrical charges and used the findings to develop a set of design rules that can improve the efficiency of organic solar cells. Organic solar cells are made with carbon-based polymer materials that have the potential to be low cost, can be made from earth-abundant materials, and have some attractive features – such as the fact that they can be made into semi-transparent or transparent window applications. In addition, as thin film solar cells they have the potential for lightweight and flexible solar applications amenable to roll-to-roll manufacturing – which could also make them easy to transport and install. However, organic solar cells have not been as efficient as silicon or perovskite solar technologies at converting light into electricity. “Organic solar cells are made of a mixture of two materials,” says Aram Amassian, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and a university faculty scholar and professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. “Both materials harvest electrons from sunlight. However, one of the materials is a polymer that harvests electrons, but then has to interact with the second material in order to pass those electrons on. The polymer is called a donor material; the other substance, typically a small molecule, is called the acceptor material. We knew that interfaces between donor and acceptor materials were responsible for a voltage loss – which is what currently limits the efficiency of organic solar cells. Our goal with this work was to gain a deeper understanding of what aspects of interfaces were responsible for the voltage loss so that we may improve them.” To address this challenge, the researchers developed a scanning-probe microscopy method that allowed them to map not only the topographic characteristics of the donor and acceptor blend, but also the energy characteristics of the donor and acceptor materials at the interfaces – such as the energy gradient at the interface and how disordered the donor and acceptor materials are at the interface. “This technique allowed us to determine how the degree of disorder of donor and acceptor molecules at the interface impacted the energy disorder,” says Daniel Dougherty, co-corresponding author of the paper and a professor of physics at NC State. “Once we had mapped the energetics of all of these interfaces, we were able to compare those findings with the results of conventional methods that characterize the overall performance of an organic solar cell’s voltage loss.” The team needed to overcome another key challenge. As the scanning-probe microscopy technique does not directly measure voltage loss, the team could not tell which interface was the main culprit. “Blends of donor and acceptor materials give rise to many different types of interfaces at once and it is not clear which interfaces are responsible for voltage losses,” Amassian says. “Our study revealed that the functional interface in modern high performance organic solar cells, such as PM6:Y6, is the sharp donor-acceptor interface,” Dougherty says. “The findings imply that this type of interface needs to be targeted to further reduce voltage losses.” “Once we identified the functional interface associated with voltage loss, we conducted a series of investigations into which factors influenced voltage loss,” Amassian says. “There has been a longstanding debate in the organic solar cell community between people who argued that voltage loss was driven by energy differential between constituent donor and acceptor materials and people who argued that voltage loss was driven by energetic disorder along interfaces. Our experiments show that both sides are correct – it’s a combination of both factors.” The researchers successfully demonstrated that it is possible to “fix” the energy differential and tune the disorder at interfaces by changing the way the donor and acceptor are blended during fabrication in such a way as to reduce the voltage loss as much as possible. “By controlling for one of the drivers of voltage loss, we were actually able to identify engineering solutions that will help the organic solar cell community minimize the other driver of voltage loss,” Amassian says. “Essentially, voltage losses are reduced by selecting a pair of materials with minimal energy offsets. Practitioners can then further reduce energy losses by identifying a solvent and processing parameters that substantially reduce interfacial disorder. We’re optimistic the design rules we developed using this technique can be used to inform organic solar cell research and development moving forward.” The paper, “Mapping Interfacial Energetic Landscape in Organic Solar Cells Reveals Pathways to Reducing Nonradiative Losses,” is published in the journal Matter. Co-first authors of the paper are Gaurab Thapa, a former Ph.D. student at NC State, and Mihirsinh Chauhan, a former postdoctoral researcher at NC State.

Thapa, Mihirsinh Chauhan, Jacob P. Mauthe, Daniel B. Dougherty and Aram Amassian, North Carolina State University Published: Oct. 30, 2024, Matter DOI: 10.1016/j.matt.2024.10.007 Abstract: Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) currently suffer from high non-radiative voltage loss (ΔVnr), which may limit them from far exceeding 20% efficiency. Disorder and energy offsets at donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces play a crucial role in minimizing the ΔVnr, but there are multiple types of D/A interfaces present in OPV active layers, which occludes current understanding of voltage losses. In this work, we combine optoelectronic measurements with local tunneling spectroscopy to identify the D/A interface relevant to ΔVnr. We measure the electronic band edge distribution to infer interfacial charge transfer (CT) state properties of the D/A interface. This delineates the influences of CT state disorder and its hybridization with the singlet state on the ΔVnr. Finally, our framework provides an ideal interface design rule toward minimizing voltage losses in next-generation OPV devices.

LHPs can efficiently convert electrical charge to light and light into electricity. They consist of thin sheets of perovskite semiconductor material that are separated by thin organic “spacer” layers. But researchers could not figure out how to engineer these materials to control their performance. The NC State team discovered that nanoplatelets, which are individual sheets of the perovskite material, form spontaneously at the surface of solutions and can play a key role in the properties of the LHP films — if they can be controlled. Within LHPs are quantum wells, which are sheets of semiconductor material sandwiched between spacer layers. Nanoplatelets serve as LEGO pieces of different thickness, where the thickness determines the quantum confinement and the energy. If the series of nanoplatelets have a thickness of two, three and four atoms in ascending order, the LHP can form efficient energy cascades. “What’s exciting is that we found we can essentially control the growth of several nanoplatelets at once, essentially tuning the size and location of quantum wells in LHP films in a reproducible manner,” said Aram Amassian, professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. “And because we can control their arrangement, energy can cascade more efficiently between the quantum wells and undergo recombination — which means the material is highly efficient at converting this energy into light in laser and LED applications.” This post was originally published in College of Engineering News. ; Engineering Perovskite Materials at the Atomic Level Paves Way for New Lasers, LEDs Researchers have developed and demonstrated a technique that allows them to engineer a class of materials called layered hybrid perovskites (LHPs) down to the atomic level, which dictates precisely how the materials convert electrical charge into light. The technique opens the door to engineering materials tailored for use in next-generation printed LEDs and lasers – and holds promise for engineering other materials for use in photovoltaic devices. Perovskites, which are defined by their crystalline structure, have desirable optical, electronic and quantum properties. LHPs consist of incredibly thin sheets of perovskite semiconductor material that are separated from each other by thin organic “spacer” layers. LHPs can be laid down as thin films consisting of multiple sheets of perovskite and organic spacer layers. These materials are desirable because they can efficiently convert electrical charge into light, making them promising for use in next-generation LEDs, lasers and photonic integrated circuits. However, while LHPs have been of interest to the research community for years, there was little understanding of how to engineer these materials in order to control their performance characteristics. To understand what the researchers discovered, you have to start with quantum wells, which are sheets of semiconductor material sandwiched between spacer layers. “We knew quantum wells were forming in LHPs – they’re the layers,” says Aram Amassian, corresponding author of a paper on the work and a professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. And understanding the size distribution of quantum wells is important because energy flows from high-energy structures to low-energy structures at the molecular level. “A quantum well that is two atoms thick has higher energy than a quantum well that is five atoms thick,” says Kenan Gundogdu, co-author of the paper and a professor of physics at NC State. “And in order to get energy to flow efficiently, you want to have quantum wells that are three and four atoms thick between the quantum wells that are two and five atoms thick. You basically want to have a gradual slope that the energy can cascade down.” “But people studying LHPs kept running into an anomaly: the size distribution of quantum wells in an LHP sample that could be detected via X-ray diffraction would be different than the size distribution of quantum wells that could be detected using optical spectroscopy,” Amassian says. “For example, diffraction might tell you that your quantum wells are two atoms thick, as well as there being a three-dimensional bulk crystal,” Amassian says. “But spectroscopy might tell you that you have quantum wells that are two atoms, three atoms, and four atoms thick, as well as the 3D bulk phase. “So, the first question we had was: why are we seeing this fundamental disconnect between X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy? And our second question was: how can we control the size and distribution of quantum wells in LHPs?” Through a series of experiments the researchers discovered that there was a key player involved in answering both questions: nanoplatelets. “Nanoplatelets are individual sheets of the perovskite material that form on the surface of the solution we use to create LHPs,” Amassian says. “We found that these nanoplatelets essentially serve as templates for layered materials that form under them. So, if the nanoplatelet is two atoms thick, the LHP beneath it forms as a series of two-atom-thick quantum wells. “However, the nanoplatelets themselves aren’t stable, like the rest of the LHP material. Instead, the thickness of nanoplatelets keeps growing, adding new layers of atoms over time. So, when the nanoplatelet is three atoms thick, it forms three-atom quantum wells, and so on. And, eventually, the nanoplatelet grows so thick that it becomes a three-dimensional crystal.” This finding also resolved the longstanding anomaly about why X-ray diffraction and optical spectroscopy were providing different results. Diffraction detects the stacking of sheets and therefore does not detect nanoplatelets, whereas optical spectroscopy detects isolated sheets. “What’s exciting is that we found we can essentially stop the growth of nanoplatelets in a controlled way, essentially tuning the size and distribution of quantum wells in LHP films,” Amassian says. “And by controlling the size and arrangement of the quantum wells, we can achieve excellent energy cascades – which means the material is highly efficient and fast at funneling charges and energy for the purposes of laser and LED applications.” When the researchers found that nanoplatelets played such a critical role in the formation of perovskite layers in LHPs, they decided to see if nanoplatelets could be used to engineer the structure and properties of other perovskite materials – such as the perovskites used to convert light into electricity in solar cells and other photovoltaic technologies. “We found that the nanoplatelets play a similar role in other perovskite materials and can be used to engineer those materials to enhance the desired structure, improving their photovoltaic performance and stability,” says Milad Abolhasani, co-author of the paper and ALCOA Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at NC State.

Danilov, Xiaotong Li, Milad Abolhasani, Kenan Gundogdu and Aram Amassian, North Carolina State University; and Ruipeng Li, Brookhaven National Laboratory Published: Oct. 11, Matter Abstract: Layered hybrid perovskites (LHPs) have emerged as promising reduced dimensional semiconductors for next generation photonic and energy applications, wherein controlling the size, orientation, and distribution of quantum wells (QWs) is of paramount importance. Here, we reveal that bulky molecular spacers act as crystal terminating ligands to form colloidal nanoplatelets (NPLs) during early stages of LHP formation. NPLs template the crystallization of LHPs. Using multi-modal diagnostics, we prove that NPLs ripen and grow, playing a decisive role in the time-evolution of QW size, population distribution and orientation. We demonstrate antisolvent drip interrupts NPL ripening and thereby controls QW orientation, population, and energy cascades within LHP films. Using this approach, we achieve low threshold amplified emission (AE) with remarkable reproducibility. We further introduce synthesized NPLs in the antisolvent step of 3D perovskites to control facet orientation and achieve enhanced efficiency and stability in wide bandgap solar cell devices compared to untextured controls.

The researchers have already demonstrated that the new technology, called RoboMapper, can rapidly identify new perovskite materials with improved stability and solar cell efficiency. “RoboMapper allows us to conduct materials testing more quickly, while also reducing both cost and energy overhead – making the entire process more sustainable,” says Aram Amassian, corresponding author of a paper on the work and a professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. Conventional materials research requires a researcher to prepare a sample and then go through multiple steps to test each sample using different instruments. This involves placing, aligning and calibrating samples as needed to collect the data. Think of it as an assembly line that is both time consuming and requires a lot of electricity to power the relevant instruments. Previous efforts to automate this process have relied largely on automating the assembly line with one sample per chip moving through the entire data collection process. This improves speed, but each of the steps still has to be done with one sample at a time. “RoboMapper also automates this process, but places dozens of samples on each chip by miniaturizing the material samples with the help of modern printing,” Amassian says. “It still performs each step of the data collection process, but it does so for multiple materials in parallel, saving time and energy.” “This makes searching for new materials far more efficient, more cost effective, and more sustainable in terms of our carbon footprint,” says Tonghui Wang, lead author of the paper and a Ph.D. student at NC State. “It’s nearly 10 times faster than previous automated techniques.” To confirm this, the team evaluated the environmental impact of traditional materials research and data collection and compared it with the RoboMapper. “It was remarkable to find that characterization is the major source of greenhouse gas emissions in materials research,” says environmental economist Lucía Serrano-Luján, co-author of the paper and a researcher at Rey Juan Carlos University and the Technical University of Cartagena. “The RoboMapper’s ability to streamline the data collection process by placing dozens of materials on the same chip reduced greenhouse gas emissions tenfold.” To demonstrate the utility of RoboMapper, the researchers focused first on perovskite materials. Perovskites, which are defined by their crystalline structure, are better than silicon at absorbing light. That means perovskite solar cells can be thinner and lighter than silicon solar cells without sacrificing the cell’s ability to convert light into electricity – making them a focal point for research into next-generation solar technologies. Specifically, the researchers focused on perovskite stability, which is one of the biggest challenges in the field. “Basically, the challenge is that perovskite materials tend to degrade when exposed to light, losing the properties that made them desirable in the first place,” Amassian says. “We’re looking for ways to engineer these materials so that they are stable – meaning they retain their desirable properties for a long time, even when exposed to light.” And the researchers had their first significant finding with RoboMapper during the technology’s proof-of-concept demonstration. The researchers tasked RoboMapper with making alloys using a defined set of elements. RoboMapper then made samples with 150 different alloy compositions and conducted optical spectroscopy and X-ray structural assessments and stability tests of those samples. RoboMapper’s tests were designed to identify whether an alloy was suitable for tandem solar cells, meaning: whether it had the crystalline structure of a perovskite; whether it had a desirable set of optical characteristics, known as the band gap; and whether it was stable when exposed to intense light. This experimental data was then used to construct a computational model that identified a specific alloy composition that it predicted would have the best combination of desired attributes. The researchers then made the desired alloy with RoboMapper and by using conventional laboratory techniques, and tested both. “We are able to quickly identify the most stable composition from a possible set of perovskite alloys at a target band gap using the specific suite of elements we confined ourselves to for this proof-of-concept work,” Amassian says. “The material we identified using RoboMapper also turned out to be more efficient at converting light into electricity in solar cell devices. Our conventional techniques validated the results from RoboMapper. “One reason RoboMapper’s experiments were able to produce such useful data is that the specific suite of experiments we used is based on previous work that informs our understanding of the relationship between what we can observe in optical tests and the stability of perovskite materials. “Next steps for this work include expanding the range of potential alloys for testing in RoboMapper,” Amassian says. “We’re open to working with industry partners to identify new materials for photovoltaics or other applications. And with support from the Office of Naval Research, we are already using RoboMapper to advance our understanding of materials for both organic solar cells and printed electronics.

Epps, Kasra Darabi, Boyu Guo, Dali Sun, Milad Abolhasani, Kenan Gundogdu and Aram Amassian, North Carolina State University; Ruipeng Li, Brookhaven National Laboratory; and Lucía Serrano-Luján, Rey Juan Carlos University and Technical University of Cartagena Published: July 25, 2023, Matter DOI: 10.1016/j.matt.2023.06.040 Abstract: The vast chemical space of emerging semiconductors, like metal halide perovskites, and their varied requirements for semiconductor applications have rendered trial-and-error environmentally unsustainable. In this work, we demonstrate RoboMapper, a materials acceleration platform (MAP), that achieves 10-fold research acceleration by formulating and palletizing semiconductors on a chip, thereby allowing high-throughput (HT) measurements to generate quantitative structure-property relationships (QSPRs) considerably more efficiently and sustainably. We leverage the RoboMapper to construct QSPR maps for the mixed ion FA1-yCsyPb(I1-xBrx)3 halide perovskite in terms of structure, bandgap, and photostability with respect to its composition. We identify wide-bandgap alloys suitable for perovskite-Si hybrid tandem solar cells exhibiting a pure cubic perovskite phase with favorable defect chemistry while achieving superior stability at the target bandgap of 1.7 eV. RoboMapper’s palletization strategy reduces environmental impacts of data generation in materials research by more than an order of magnitude, paving the way for sustainable data-driven materials research.

More and more NC State students need to discern how to thrive in their courses via a virtual or remote environment. In turn, instructors continue to fine-tune teaching methodologies to provide the most successful outcomes possible for all students, regardless of where a student might be located. One specific example is within the Department of Chemistry, where faculty and staff prepare students to put their learning into practice through hands-on research about cutting-edge topics. Through organic chemistry labs, students learn to use and combine specific safety protocols and lab techniques. These labs can be challenging environments. Some students, however, might find themselves in circumstances that go beyond the typical learning challenges. For example, some students might be interacting with unfamiliar equipment in a lab with time constraints, which can be intimidating. Other students might not have access to the lab because of military deployment, disability or distance learning. For some students, working within the lab environment might be potentially harmful due to a physical condition or chemical sensitivity. Although attempts to replicate the lab experience in a video or using virtual reality (VR) have helped, they lack key components of practical laboratory courses. Those resources don’t emphasize helping students interpret imperfect results, troubleshoot reactions and experimental setups, or reason through varied and unexpected outcomes. Instructors realized that a method was needed to allow students a “hands-on” experience without actually having to be inside the lab itself. Using a DELTA Grant to Meet the Need Professor Aram Amassian, College of Engineering, and Associate Professor Ryan Chiechi, College of Sciences, worked together as Principal Investigators (PIs) with a team of DELTA specialists using a DELTA Exploratory Grant to meet this specific instructional need. To begin, the team reviewed existing solutions like a VR laboratory space and the Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) lab, so that students could complete hands-on work remotely using a robotic arm serving as their “hands.” “This particular lab — the Rob-O-Chem lab — is well suited for this project, as it depends heavily on manipulating tubes physically,” Amassian explained. “Additionally, the resulting TLC relates to variables associated with the physical preparation and manipulation of real-world objects. TLC also does not pose any safety hazards and does not require specialized or sophisticated equipment, which facilitates scaling and disseminating the adapted laboratory course.” Using this technique allows those chemistry students who cannot physically enter the lab space to still engage in the trial and error that is fundamental to learning how to prepare and interpret results. The virtually controlled robotic arm provides a more flexible learning opportunity for more students. Defining the Project Goals For this grant, the project goals for the team were multi-faceted: Explore and demonstrate the capabilities of robotics in the lab to mimic an authentic experience for students. Create a virtual approach that mimics an authentic lab experience and provides instructionally meaningful content, for example following user mistakes or allowing key decision points. Establish a secure, authenticated and extensible API connection between a dedicated lab computer and a purpose-built TLC workstation with an integrated robotic arm in the lab. Design a user interface that provides for visualization and interaction with the TLC workstation and the robotic arm. The team used the robotic arm within the lab — which they eventually named Rob-O-Chem — to execute the TLC experiment that is performed in CH 222: Organic Chemistry I Lab. Using a dedicated computer within the lab space, the team established a secure, authenticated and extensible API connection with the robotic arm. An interface was also developed that allowed students to visualize and interact with the TLC workstation and the robotic arm. A student web client provides students with live video streams into the lab space and actions to perform the TLC experiment. Using the Rob-O-Chem technology via the web client, students could remotely control the equipment and manipulate variables, analyze results in real-time, and practice the technique. Specifically, students could run through a simulation of the most nuanced, error-prone part of the lab that required using a tube filled with a solution to precisely mark a plate for the experiment. Students could retry this procedure as many times as needed by tapping on the web interface and then choosing to submit this “performance” to the robot, which would repeat their movements within fractions of millimeters and use their exact timing down to the millisecond. This approach provided additional opportunities to learn the technique while lowering the stakes during the lab. The simulation component was also available outside of student lab time so they could prepare in advance. Students complete the experiment using the Rob-O-Chem technology virtually through a web interface. Secondary Outcome: Raw Footage Becomes Usable Video While working on the grant project, DELTA’s Director of Digital Media Innovation Mike Cuales requested footage of the first test of the Rob-O-Chem lab technology used during the grant. Because the technology involved was in a pilot stage, capturing footage of the students using it would be critical both as documentary evidence of the work achieved as well as how the technology might be used going forward. John Gordon, DELTA’s associate director of instructional media production, took the suggestion for the footage a step further. Gordon proposed using the footage to create a short video that told the story of the technology and its future benefits. Chiechi was excited to have the opportunity to gain an additional outcome from the grant. “When John approached me with the idea regarding the video, I was enthusiastic about the possibilities,” Chiechi said. “I have difficulty getting people to understand the overall concepts of the Rob-O-Chem lab and the benefits of the technology. Although Rob-O-Chem is not an available technology, we can use the video to show what we accomplished, to explain the underlying motivation for automating undergraduate laboratory courses with robotics (which was the topic of the original DELTA Grant), and to promote the project in the pursuit of future financial support for continued efforts.” Gordon agreed with Chiechi’s assessment of how the video, as a byproduct of the original grant, can be useful in the future. “The video can be used on websites, in emails, or in presentations,” Gordon explained. “The technology developed during the pilot is a good first step but more research is needed to perfect it. Sharing the video can help explain the benefits of the technology and hopefully generate more interest in funding the necessary research.” According to Chiechi, the DELTA team was “all in” in their willingness to help make this project as successful as possible. “Everyone from the DELTA side was absolutely amazing and put in the extra effort that was above and beyond our expectations from the grant,” Chiechi said. “We are incredibly happy with the results and can’t wait to share them!” DELTA Grant project team members for this grant included: Aram Amassian, Professor of Materials Science and Engineering Ryan Chiechi, Associate Professor of Chemistry Kim Gervase, Director, Strategic Education and Industry Partnerships, Organic and Carbon Electronics Laboratories Cassie Lilly, Associate Teaching Professor Joe Schroedl, Undergraduate Research Assistant, Amassian Research Group Varsha Verma, Graduate Student Christine Belledin, Project Lead David Tredwell, Team Lead, Multimedia Development Stephen Waddell, Immersive Media Developer Jessica White, Senior Instructional Designer DELTA contributors included: Téa Blumer, Lead Multimedia Designer Michael Castro, Lead Instructional Media Designer/Developer John Gordon, Associate Director, Instructional Media Production Relly Moorer, Cinematographer and Post-Production Specialist Andrew Wiedner, Multimedia/Web Developer Chris Willis, Assistant Director, Research and Analysis Donnie Wrights, Associate Director, Educational Media Design Learn more about DELTA Grants and how to apply. ; Modified Soft Material Promises Better Bioelectronics The scientific community has long been enamored of the potential for soft bioelectronic devices, but has faced hurdles in identifying materials that are biocompatible and have all of the necessary characteristics to operate effectively. Researchers have now taken a step in the right direction, modifying an existing biocompatible material so that it conducts electricity efficiently in wet environments and can send and receive ionic signals from biological media. “We’re talking about an order-of-magnitude improvement in the ability of soft bioelectronic materials to function efficiently in biological environments,” says Aram Amassian, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and a professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. “This is not an incremental advance.” There is tremendous interest in creating organic bioelectronics and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), with a wide range of biomedical applications. However, one limiting factor is identifying nontoxic materials that can conduct electricity, interacting with ions – which is critical to functioning in biological environments, and operating efficiently in the aqueous, water-based environments of biological systems. One material of interest has been PEDOT:PSS, which is a nontoxic polymer that is able to conduct electricity. PEDOT:PSS is used to create thin films which are effectively fiber networks that are only nanometers wide. Electrical current can run through the fibers, which are also sensitive to ions in their environment. “The idea is that, because ions interact with the fibers – and affect their conductivity – PEDOT:PSS can be used to sense what is happening around the fibers,” says Laine Taussig, co-first author of the paper and a recent Ph.D. graduate of NC State who now works at the Air Force Research laboratory. “Essentially, PEDOT:PSS would be able to monitor its biological environment. But we could also use the electric current to influence the ions surrounding the PEDOT:PSS, sending signals to that biological environment,” says Masoud Ghasemi, co-first author and a former postdoctoral fellow at NC State who is now a postdoctoral fellow at Penn State. However, PEDOT:PSS’s structural stability declines significantly when placed in aqueous environments – like biological systems. That’s because PEDOT:PSS is a single material made from two components: the PEDOT, which conducts electricity and is not soluble in water; and PSS, which responds to ions, but is water soluble. In other words, the PSS makes the material start to fall apart when it comes into contact with water. Previous efforts to stabilize the structure of PEDOT:PSS have been able to help the material withstand aqueous environments, but have both hurt PEDOT:PSS’s performance as a conductor and made it more difficult for ions to interact with the material’s PSS components. “Our work here is important, because we’ve found a new way to make a PEDOT:PSS that is structurally stable in wet environments and able to both interact with ions and conduct electricity very efficiently,” says George Malliaras, co-corresponding author and Prince Philip Professor of Technology at Cambridge University. Specifically, the researchers start with PEDOT:PSS in solution and then add ionic salts. Given time, the ionic salts interact with the PEDOT:PSS, causing it to self-assemble into fibers with a unique structure that remains stable in wet environments. This modified PEDOT:PSS is then dried and the ionic salts rinsed off. “We already knew that ionic salts could affect PEDOT:PSS,” Amassian says. “What’s new here is that by giving the ionic salts more time to see the full extent of those effects, we modified the crystalline structures of the PEDOT and the PSS to essentially lace themselves together at the molecular scale. This makes the PSS impervious to the water in the environment, allowing the PEDOT:PSS to maintain its structural stability at the molecular level.” “The change is also hierarchical, meaning that there are shifts at the molecular level all the way up to macroscale,” says Yaroslava Yingling, co-author of the paper and Kobe Steel Distinguished Professor of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State. “The ionic salts cause the PEDOT:PSS to essentially reorganize itself into a phase that resembles a web-like gel that is preserved in both dry and wet environments.” In addition to being stable in aqueous environments, the resulting films retain their conductivity. What’s more, because the PEDOT and PSS are tightly interwoven, it’s easy for ions to reach and interact with the PSS component of the material. “This new phase of PEDOT:PSS was used to create OECTs by our collaborators at Cambridge,” Amassian says. “And those OECTs set a new state-of-the-art standard in both volumetric capacitance and electronic carrier mobility. In other words, it’s the new gold standard in both conductivity and ion responsiveness in bio-friendly electronics. “Given that PEDOT:PSS is transparent, flexible, stretchable, conductive and biocompatible, the range of potential applications is exciting – extending well beyond the biomedical sector,” says Enrique Gomez, co-corresponding author and a professor at Penn State. The paper, “Electrostatic Self-Assembly Yields a Structurally-Stabilized PEDOT:PSS With Efficient Mixed Transport and High Performance OECTs,” is published in the journal Matter.

Keene and George G. Malliaras, University of Cambridge; Ruipeng Li, Brookhaven National Laboratory; and Enrique D. Gomez, Pennsylvania State University Published: Jan. 16, Matter DOI: 10.1016/j.matt.2023.12.021 Abstract: Organic electronics and organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are gaining importance for their potential to replicate complex biological processes of the human brain. Such devices require polymeric materials to efficiently transport and couple ionic and electronic charges in aqueous media, therefore demanding water-insoluble systems capable of efficient electronic and ionic conductions. This has created a fundamental stability-performance compromise for water-soluble conducting polymers such as poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), whereby stability has been achieved at the expense of electronic properties. Here, we demonstrate a breakthrough in structural stabilization of PEDOT:PSS through electrostatic self-assembly (ESA) that leads to the formation of an efficient mixed conductor in a hydrated state. Benefiting from the multiscale morphology control provided by ESA, PEDOT:PSS mixed conductors exhibit superior carrier mobility and high volumetric capacitance resulting in a state-of-the-art thin-film OECT figure of merit (μC∗ = 752.5 F/cmVs) in aqueous media, making this approach suitable for creating robust mixed conductors for bioelectronic applications and beyond.

Feb 17, 2023 Amassian Named University Faculty Scholar NC State’s 2022-23 class of University Faculty Scholars was announced today. These 22 early- and mid-career faculty receive this designation in recognition of their outstanding academic achievements and contributions to NC State through their teaching, scholarship and service to the university and beyond. ; Wake Tech Students Gain STEM Research Experience at NC State This post was authored by Kim Gervase, director of strategic education and industry partnerships for ORaCEL. On April 14, Wake Tech students presented their research to an audience of professors, graduate students and postdocs at NC State. This was the culminating event for a 10-week internship program in which NC State’s Carbon Electronics Cluster partnered with Wake Tech to provide seven students in Wake Tech’s STEM Academic Research & Training (START) program paid internships in a combination of on-site and remote research experiences. Their projects were based in three labs run by Harald Ade, Goodnight Innovation Distinguished Professor of Physics; Aram Amassian, professor of materials science and engineering; and Ryan Chiechi, associate professor of chemistry. All three faculty are members of the Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program in the Carbon Electronics Cluster. Damien Johnson, a first-year student at Wake Tech, applied to be a START intern because of his interest in STEM and his desire to transfer into NC State’s aerospace engineering program. He found that research brought to life what he is learning in his classes. “Being in START has opened my eyes to what research scientists really do,” he said. “After this semester, I feel confident that I can perform research and am comfortable presenting my findings to others.” Wake Tech students presented their research to an audience of professors, graduate students and postdocs at NC State. Wake Tech START projects are done in partnership with local universities and industry partners. The Carbon Electronics Cluster faculty were inspired to apply for these positions because they feel that the community colleges in the area are an underutilized pipeline of talented students who can benefit from early research experiences before they get to campus. “We hope that by giving interested students an insight into what research is and providing them access to work alongside graduate students in our world-class facilities, we can spark a desire to pursue rewarding careers in STEM that can be enriching to them personally as well as valuable to society,” Amassian said. The START program is funded with a $1.4 million grant from the National Science Foundation, along with contributions from Terracon Foundation, the Christman Company, Clancy & Theys, Brooks Pierce and DeLisa Alexander. The students are hired and paid for a 60-hour commitment that includes 20 hours of training and community-building and 40 hours of research and technical poster-building. All students were assigned a faculty mentor at Wake Tech and were also paired with a graduate student or professor in the Carbon Electronics Cluster who worked closely with them to develop a project, teach them how to use the necessary instrumentation to collect data, and create a poster showcasing their technical work. “The START Showcase gives our interns practice presenting their work, the confidence that they are part of the STEM community and the joy of being the ‘expert’ in the room,” said Jackie Swanik, associate dean of mathematics, sciences and engineering at Wake Tech.

Or join a Skype call. Or even send an email. Since he’s part of NC State’s Bioinformatics faculty cluster, he can just walk down the hall. “The barrier to asking questions is essentially zero,” Reif said. Like others in this interdisciplinary field, Reif studies biological problems through data. The cluster is made up of four faculty — Fred Wright, Denis Fourches, Dahlia Nielsen and Reif — who work alongside other professors, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and support staff in diverse scientific fields such as genetics, statistics, chemistry and biology. They’re solving problems that affect everyone, like toxic chemicals’ effects on our bodies and how genetics influences our bodies’ response to these effects. These problems span traditional academic department boundaries, so pooling expertise means more answers for all. The Bioinformatics cluster is part of NC State’s groundbreaking Chancellor’s Faculty Excellence Program, which aims to put faculty together, both physically and intellectually, to combine ideas and experience in ways that solve big problems. These researchers are showing that when you put brilliant minds from different areas of science in one place, new partnerships that lead to groundbreaking discoveries are forged around shared conference tables, in chance hallway encounters, over cookie breaks or even during movie nights. Bridging the Gaps Faculty clusters and interdisciplinary work have become hot topics in higher education around the world, but this“new” interdisciplinary approach has actually permeated science for centuries. Ancient Greek philosophers sought to understand the world by amassing knowledge in many different areas, including metaphysics, logic and biology. The cluster model mimics groups like the Royal Society, established in London in the 17th century by astronomer and architect Sir Christopher Wren to bring together sharp minds from across the scientific spectrum. NC State’s program, focusing on assembling groups of faculty with complementary areas of expertise to study interdisciplinary research challenges, was one of the first major initiatives Chancellor Randy Woodson announced after coming to the university in 2010. Since the program’s launch in 2011, NC State has hired nearly 60 faculty in 20 cluster areas. The College of Sciences has the largest number of cluster faculty of any college, with 14. The graduate students’ work area is located across the hall from faculty offices, which makes it easy for faculty like Denis Fourches to pop in to discuss projects and look at data. The well-regarded program has spurred development of new graduate academic programs and generated partnerships with government and industry. It’s also a key tool for recruiting top graduate students and faculty — especially those with research interests and backgrounds that don’t align with traditional academic departments. “The cluster program was a way for me to see a fit for myself here,” said Reif, who came to NC State from the Environmental Protection Agency. “It was exciting that they wanted people who are good at different things to bridge across disciplines and come together.” Getting Closer The Bioinformatics cluster grew out of the university’s Bioinformatics Research Center, which was one of the first centers in the nation to embrace bioinformatics as its own discipline. The conference room on the Bioinformatics hall is where faculty and students a place to gather for both formal presentations and informal brainstorming sessions. As cluster faculty were hired and the center grew, it needed a new home where faculty could work alongside one another and have access to the academic heart of campus. So the university worked with the faculty to renovate the third floor of Ricks Hall, a stately yellow brick building adjacent to Hillsborough Street. The goal was to create a mix of open and private spaces where faculty and students could work separately or together. “Team science is very important here,” said Wright. “So we needed a layout to foster that kind of work.” At the heart of the floor are two large collaborative spaces: a conference room and a lounge. These are places to gather for everything from formal presentations to brainstorming meetings to movie nights. Elsewhere, offices and smaller shared workspaces give individuals or small groups some separation, while keeping them close enough to others to allow easy exchange of questions and ideas. The proximity to College of Sciences buildings, D.H. Hill Library and the creative culture of Hillsborough Street adds to the space’s appeal. “Because we were able to fully participate in the design phase, we could create a work space best suited to the cluster’s needs,” said David Bird, William Neal Reynolds Distinguished Professor in the Department of Entomology and Plant Pathology, and the cluster’s coordinator. “It’s an atmosphere that encourages collaboration and enables our best work.” Answers Across the Hall Why, in this age of near-instant electronic communication, is being able to easily pop into someone’s office still important? Recent research has shown that when low-cost airfares are available in pairs of cities where scientific collaborators are located, they collaborate almost 50 percent more often. And it’s even easier to collaborate when you don’t have to leave your building. A walk to the bathroom or refrigerator can mean you run into a colleague who can help you think about your work in a new way. “Being together in the same building has been a game changer for this cluster,” Fourches said. “Since we are not spread out all over campus, we can have collaborations that are quicker and more successful.” Nielsen’s office is directly across the hall from Reif’s, which makes it especially easy for them to interact frequently and mesh their different, but complementary, areas of expertise. That could mean consulting on a journal article or brainstorming experiments over a cup of coffee. “He had a grant proposal he had to turn in, and he asked me to read over it,” Nielsen said. “The people in his field know his research very well, whereas I know what he does, but I don’t know the details of it. So I can read through it and point out places where he needs to explain things better to people who don’t have an inside perspective.” This proximity and easy access to other perspectives also benefits the students, who gain knowledge and experience that inform their current work and boost their résumés for the future. “When you go to the graduate student area, you see a chemist next to a toxicologist working on the same data set with two different perspectives,” Fourches said. “That is unique. I haven’t seen it anywhere else in the country.” Chemicals, Cells and Cookies Being able to regularly share ideas with other researchers in the cluster setting has both shaped the Bioinformatics team’s existing work and inspired new projects. “I had ideas beforehand about how genetic variation might affect how individuals respond to chemicals,” Reif said. “But being here around statistical geneticists has helped me add some rigorous science to those ideas, so now I can test them to see if those hypotheses are true.” One project Reif has worked on with Wright, a statistical geneticist, is an Environmental Protection Agency-funded study of the effects of toxic environmental substances on human health, and particularly the heart. This work could open up future research possibilities for testing individuals’ responses to toxicity. The whiteboards in Dahlia Nielsen’s office display the fruit of many brainstorming sessions, like this one with research scholar Dereje Jima. Both Reif and Fourches have also individually studied nanomaterials, with Reif focusing on their biological impact and Fourches researching them from a chemical angle. Now the two are bringing together their individual perspectives to develop new methods for determining how properties like size and reactivity affect these tiny materials’ potential impacts on human health and the environment. The cluster also engages in research that is a bit less serious, though no less scientifically rigorous. A whiteboard in one of the small conference rooms displays a grid where faculty and students list their numerical ratings for various cookies provided for sampling. Their statistical bent comes out in ratings with decimal points and controls for the “coffee x cookie interaction effect.” Students and faculty sample and rate cookies to determine the statistical winners. The cookie rating is just one way that the cluster builds community, which is key to creating an atmosphere where people feel comfortable openly exchanging ideas — and also one in which they enjoy coming to work. Whiteboards in the hallway display hand-drawn cartoons and event announcements, and a jigsaw puzzle of donuts sits on the coffee table in the lounge, where graduate students often gather on evenings or weekends to watch sports or movies. An espresso machine in Reif’s office attracts those in need of a caffeine fix, and Nielsen frequently holds meetings at the table in her office that result in controlled chaos on her two large whiteboards. “I learn so much from my colleagues every day, and I also really enjoy being around them,” Nielsen said. “It’s a great place to work.” This post was originally published in College of Sciences News. ; Corralling Ions Improves Viability of Next Generation Solar Cells Researchers have discovered that channeling ions into defined pathways in perovskite materials improves the stability and operational performance of perovskite solar cells. The finding paves the way for a new generation of lighter, more flexible, and more efficient solar cell technologies suitable for practical use. Perovskite materials, which are defined by their crystalline structure, are better at absorbing light than silicon is. That means that perovskite solar cells can be thinner and lighter than silicon solar cells without sacrificing the cell’s ability to convert light into electricity. “That opens the door to a host of new technologies, such as flexible, lightweight solar cells, or layered solar cells (known as tandems) that can be far more efficient than the solar harvesting technology used today in so-called solar farms,” says Aram Amassian, corresponding author of a paper on the discovery. “There’s interest in integrating perovskite materials into silicon solar cell technologies, which would improve their efficiency from 25% to 40% while also making use of existing infrastructure.” Amassian is a professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. However, working with perovskite materials poses a challenge, because – to date – it has not been possible to sustain long term operational stability in perovskite solar cells. Perovskites are ionic materials, and when a voltage is applied to a perovskite, it causes ions to migrate through the material. These migrating ions are believed to contribute to chemical and structural changes in the material that ultimately make the materials inefficient and unstable. To make practical perovskite solar cells, researchers need to find a way to address this problem. “We have not found a way to prevent ions from moving through perovskite materials, but we have found that it is possible to steer these ions into a safe conduit that does not impair the material’s structural integrity or performance,” Amassian says. “It’s a big step forward.” The safe conduit, in this case, is something called a grain boundary. Perovskite materials are multi-crystalline materials. That means that when you are “growing” a perovskite, the material forms as a series of crystals – or “grains” – that are flush with each other. These grains are responsible for absorbing light and generating the charges responsible for the electrical current. Each of those grains has the same crystalline structure, but the grains may be oriented in slightly different directions. The area where the grains touch is called a grain boundary. “What we’ve found is that grains are better protected from impairment when the ions move predominantly along the grain boundary,” says first author and co-corresponding author Masoud Ghasemi, a former postdoctoral researcher at NC State who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Penn State. “Coupling this with what is already known about perovskite materials, it’s clear that problems start when grain boundaries are weak, which makes it easier for ions to move into the grains themselves. Designing stronger grain boundaries that protect the grains is essential to block migrating ions and other harmful species like oxygen from entering the grains, mitigating problematic chemical and structural changes in the material.” “This is an important insight, because there are established techniques we can use to engineer perovskite materials and their grain boundaries; we can now make use of these approaches to protect the grains,” Amassian says. “We demonstrate how those techniques strengthen grain boundaries in this paper. In short, we now know what needs to be done to make far more stable perovskites.” The work may also inform the development of more efficient energy storage technologies. “This work advances our fundamental understanding of how ions move through any crystalline material that can carry charge, not just halide perovskites,” Amassian says. “We’re excited to talk to colleagues who work on energy storage about how this may inform the engineering of faster ion conductors.” The paper, “A multiscale ion diffusion framework sheds light on the diffusion–stability–hysteresis nexus in metal halide perovskites,” is published in the journal Nature Materials.

Lefler, Laine Taussig, Mihirsinh Chauhan, Garrett Baucom, Taesoo Kim and Aram Amassian, North Carolina State University; Kai Wang, Enrique D.

Atkin, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Published: Feb. 27, Nature Materials DOI: 10.1038/s41563-023-01488-2 Abstract: Stability and current–voltage hysteresis stand as major obstacles to the commercialization of metal halide perovskites. Both phenomena have been associated with ion migration, with anecdotal evidence that stable devices yield low hysteresis. However, the underlying mechanisms of the complex stability–hysteresis link remain elusive. Here, we present a multiscale diffusion framework that describes vacancy-mediated halide diffusion in polycrystalline metal halide perovskites, differentiating fast grain boundary diffusivity from volume diffusivity that is two to four orders of magnitude slower. Our results reveal an inverse relationship between the activation energies of grain boundary and volume diffusions, such that stable metal halide perovskites exhibiting smaller volume diffusivities are associated with larger grain boundary diffusivities and reduced hysteresis. The elucidation of multiscale halide diffusion in metal halide perovskites reveals complex inner couplings between ion migration in the volume of grains versus grain boundaries, which in turn can predict the stability and hysteresis of metal halide perovskites, providing a clearer path to addressing the outstanding challenges of the field. ; Study Finds Current Corporate Sustainability Reporting Misses the Mark A new study finds that corporate sustainability reporting often focuses on issues that are unimportant to stakeholders, and offers specific suggestions to improve the content of future corporate sustainability reporting efforts. “Right now, most corporate entities rely on guidelines from the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) when developing their sustainability reports,” says Marianne Bradford, a professor of accounting at North Carolina State University and lead author of a paper on the work. “We wanted to know whether stakeholders – particularly consumers – care about the aspects of sustainability those GRI guidelines promote. And our findings show that it’s a mixed bag.” “These findings are important because industry standards on sustainability reporting are evolving,” says Scott Showalter, a co-author of the paper and professor of practice at NC State. “As a result, it’s valuable to have a good understanding of the sustainability issues important to consumers, who are the most important, influential group of corporate stakeholders. “And these results are also timely,” Showalter adds. “The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board is currently developing measures for 70 different industries. To move forward with those efforts without considering the needs of all stakeholders would be a mistake, and our study offers insight into the perspective of a very important group of stakeholders.” To determine the issues important to consumers, the researchers first compiled data on sustainability reporting from 15 companies in wide range of industries, ultimately amassing a list of 145 types of activities that companies reported. They then winnowed the list down to 71 activities that were unambiguously associated with one of the six GRI sustainability “dimensions.” Such dimensions include “economic,” such as reducing trade barriers; “product responsibility,” such as disclosing serious accidents related to products; and “environment,” such as utilizing renewable energy resources. The researchers then surveyed 505 professionals, asking survey participants to what extent they thought each of the 71 sustainability activities was important to sustainability. Specifically, survey respondents were asked to answer the questions in their role as consumers, rather than in any professional capacity. “An in-depth analysis found that some of the GRI dimensions did not resonate with consumers at all – particularly the economic and product responsibility dimensions,” Bradford says. But other issues were clearly seen as important – including some issues that were not clearly addressed by the GRI sustainability dimensions. The researchers used the survey responses to identify six sustainability dimensions that consumers felt were important. And, for each dimension, the researchers included a list of specific actions that consumers highlighted as most relevant: Environmental Stewardship: including minimizing climate impact, sustaining biodiversity and recycling; Risk and Compliance: including the implementation of training and education efforts related to risk reduction; Community Building: including investing in community revitalization; Social Justice: including prohibiting child labor and supporting laws that prohibit discrimination; Employment Opportunities: including offering leadership training; and Employee Education: including providing employees with information on how to protect their personal data. “What is clear from our findings is that if a corporation is serious about sustainability, these are the things that it should be doing – as ends in themselves,” says Paul Williams, a co-author on the paper and professor of accounting at NC State. “It’s about how you operate your business, not just what you’re reporting,” agrees Showalter. The researchers note that since conducting their survey, but before publishing the findings, the GRI independently modified its own sustainability dimensions – adding a seventh dimension that focuses on risk and compliance. “So, clearly, we were not the only ones who identified this as an important area for stakeholders,” Bradford says. The paper, “Corporate Sustainability Reporting and Stakeholder Concerns: Is there a Disconnect?” is published in the journal Accounting Horizons. The paper was co-authored by Julie Earp, an associate professor of information technology at NC State. The work was done with support from the Institute of Management Accountants’ Foundation for Applied Research. -shipman- Note to Editors: The study abstract follows. “Corporate Sustainability Reporting and Stakeholder Concerns: Is there a Disconnect?” Authors: Marianne Bradford, Julia B. Earp, Scott Showalter and Paul F. Williams, North Carolina State University Published: online Jan. 13, Accounting Horizons DOI: 10.2308/acch-51639 Abstract: The number of companies reporting their corporate sustainability (CS) activities has significantly increased over the last decade. The result being a wide variability in the types of activities being reported and the ways the information is presented. An unanswered question is whether the information being reported by companies following the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) CS framework is of interest to arguably one of the primary stakeholder groups, customers. Our study seeks to fill this knowledge gap by comparing content of CS reports to results from a large-scale consumer stakeholder survey. By performing factor analysis on stakeholder evaluation of the importance of CS activities, we find that consumers see different dimensions than those put forth by the GRI framework, thereby suggesting a disconnect between corporate sustainability reporting and stakeholder views and interests. Our results indicate that risk and compliance is a dimension of interest to customers, while the GRI economic dimension is not viewed as important. Additionally, a new dimension of social justice is the most important to consumer stakeholders. Furthermore, the study highlights particular activities within each factor that are most important to the consumer stakeholder group. This research has implications for preparers of sustainability reports and organizations, such as the GRI, that establish guidance for sustainability reporting.

Because these perovskites can be synthesized at low temperatures, the advance opens the door to new research into flexible electronics and potentially reduced manufacturing costs for electronic devices. Hybrid perovskite materials contain both organic and inorganic components and can be synthesized from inks, making them amenable to large-area roll-to-roll fabrication. These materials are the subject of extensive research for use in solar cells, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and photodetectors. However, there have been challenges in integrating single-crystal hybrid perovskites into more classical electronic devices, such as transistors. Single-crystal hybrid perovskites are preferable because single-crystalline materials have more desirable properties than polycrystalline materials; polycrystalline materials contain more defects that adversely affect a material’s electronic properties. The challenge in incorporating single-crystal hybrid perovskites into electronics stems from the fact that these macroscopic crystals, when synthesized using conventional techniques, have rough, irregular edges. This makes it difficult to integrate with other materials in such a way that the materials make the high-quality contacts necessary in electronic devices. The researchers got around this problem by synthesizing the hybrid perovskite crystals between two laminated surfaces, essentially creating a single-crystal hybrid perovskite sandwich. The perovskite conforms to the materials above and below, resulting in a sharp interface between the materials. The substrate and superstrate, the “bread” in the sandwich, can be anything from glass slides to silicon wafers that are already embedded with electrodes – resulting in a ready-made transistor or circuit. The researchers can further fine-tune the electrical properties of the perovskite by selecting different halides for use in the perovskite’s chemical make-up. The choice of halide determines the bandgap of the material, which affects the color appearance of the resulting semiconductor and leads to transparent and even imperceptible electronic devices when using high-bandgap perovskites. “We have demonstrated the ability to create working field-effect transistors using single-crystal hybrid perovskite materials fabricated in ambient air,” says Aram Amassian, corresponding author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of materials science and engineering at NC State. “That’s of interest because traditional single-crystal materials have to be manufactured in ultra-high vacuum, high-temperature environments, and often require exquisite epitaxial growth,” Amassian says. “Hybrid perovskites can be grown from solution, essentially from an ink, in ambient air at temperatures below 100 degrees Celsius. This makes them attractive from a cost and manufacturing standpoint. It also makes them compatible with flexible, plastic-based substrates, meaning that they may have applications in flexible electronics and in the internet of things (IoT). “That said, there are still major challenges here,” Amassian says. “For example, current hybrid perovskites contain lead, which is toxic and therefore not something that’s desirable for applications like wearable electronics. However, research is ongoing to develop hybrid perovskites that don’t contain lead or that are even entirely metal-free. This is an exciting area of research, and we feel this work is a significant step forward for the device integration of these materials, leading to the development of new technological applications.” The paper, “Single crystal hybrid perovskite field-effect transistors,” is published in the journal Nature Communications.

Published: Dec. 17, Nature Communications DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-07706-9 Abstract: The fields of photovoltaics, photodetection and light emission have seen tremendous activity in recent years with the advent of hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites. Yet, there have been far fewer reports of perovskite-based field-effect transistors. The lateral and interfacial transport requirements of transistors make them particularly vulnerable to surface contamination and defects rife in polycrystalline films and bulk single crystals. Here, we demonstrate a spatially-confined inverse temperature crystallization strategy which synthesizes micrometre-thin single crystals of methylammonium lead halide perovskites MAPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) with sub-nanometer surface roughness and very low surface contamination. These benefit the integration of MAPbX3 crystals into ambipolar transistors and yield record, room-temperature field-effect mobility up to 4.7 and 1.5 cm2 V-1 s-1 in p and n channel devices respectively, with 104 to 105 on-off ratio and low turn-on voltages. This work paves the way for integrating hybrid perovskite crystals into printed, flexible and transparent electronics.

New research sheds light on the science behind these engineering solutions and paves the way for developing more efficient halide perovskite solar cells. “This is about material design,” says Aram Amassian, co-corresponding author of a paper on the work and an associate professor of materials science and engineering at North Carolina State University. “If you want to intentionally engineer halide perovskite solar cells that have the desirable characteristics you’re looking for, you have to understand not only how the material behaves under different conditions, but why,” Amassian says. “This work gives us a fuller understanding of this class of materials, and that understanding will illuminate our work moving forward.” Halide perovskites are basically salts, with positively and negatively charged components that come together to form a neutral compound. And they have several characteristics that make them desirable for manufacturing high-efficiency solar cells. They can be dissolved into a liquid and then form high-quality crystals at low temperatures, which is attractive from a manufacturing standpoint. In addition, they are easy to repair and can tolerate defects in the material without seeing a big drop-off in their semiconductor properties. An international team of researchers delved into a key phenomenon related to halide perovskite solar cell synthesis and processing. It involves the fact that adding cesium and rubidium into the synthesis process of mixed halide perovskite compounds makes the resulting solar cell more chemically homogeneous – which is desirable, since this makes the material’s characteristics more uniform throughout the cell. But until now, no one knew why. To investigate the issue, the researchers used time-resolved, X-ray diagnostics to capture and track changes in the crystalline compounds formed throughout the synthesis process. The measurements were performed at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source. “These studies are critical in defining the next steps toward the market readiness of perovskite-based solar cells,” says Stefaan De Wolf, co-corresponding author of the paper and an associate professor of materials science and engineering at the King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST). “What we found is that some of the precursors, or ingredients, want to form several compounds other than the one we want, which can cluster key elements irregularly throughout the material,” Amassian says. “That was something we didn’t know before. “We also found that introducing cesium and rubidium into the process at the same time effectively suppresses the formation of those other compounds, facilitating the formation of the desired, homogeneous halide perovskite compound that is used to make high performance solar cells.” Next steps for the work include translating these lessons from laboratory-based spin-coating to large area manufacturing platforms which will enable the high throughput fabrication of perovskite solar cells.

Smilgies, Cornell University Published: June 6, 2019, Joule DOI: 10.1016/j.joule.2019.05.016 Abstract: Mixed lead halide perovskite solar cells have been demonstrated to benefit tremendously from the addition of Cs+ and Rb+, but its root cause is yet to be understood. This hinders further improvement, and processing approaches remain largely empirical. We address the challenge by tracking the solidification of precursors in situ and linking the evolutions of different crystalline phases to the presence of Cs+ and Rb+. In their absence, the perovskite film is inherently unstable, segregating into MAI- and FABr-rich phases. Adding either Cs+ or Rb+ is shown to alter the solidification process of the perovskite films. The optimal addition of both Cs+ and Rb+ drastically suppress phase segregation and promotes the spontaneous formation of the desired a phase. We propose that the synergistic effect is due to the collective benefits of Cs+ and Rb+ on the formation kinetics of the perovskite phase and on the halide distribution throughout the film.

In current solar panels, only 20% of available energy is typically transformed into electricity. An NC State professor is leading the development of more effective solar panels cells so that this renewable energy source can replace dwindling fossil fuels. At the same time, this work is establishing more accessible ways to do research in science, technology, engineering and mathematic fields. In the 2010s, Aram Amassian, a professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, pioneered new processes through which to coat materials using inks. These in situ experiments allow researchers to collect data about the function of the ink during its fabrication as opposed to after it has formed. This way, researchers can more precisely identify when and how to intervene to control materials’ various properties. The ink can be essentially edited closer to real time. Now, Amassian’s lab conducts such in situ experiments using artificial intelligence and robotics to develop efficient solar panel materials. “We need to move quickly and develop technologies faster than climate change is occurring,” Amassian said. “To do this, we need to transform the way in which we discover new materials, create new solutions and deploy new technologies.” Interdisciplinarity is vital to Amassian’s work. His lab integrates electrical and computer engineering into materials science to develop artificially intelligent robots that help conduct solar energy research. These robots automatically mix, apply and assess solutions that could better transform solar energy into electricity, accelerating the development of innovative materials. “These problems we’re trying to solve are really complicated,” Amassian said. “At some point, they go beyond the capabilities of one person or one discipline and require data science.” Tonghui “Tony” Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, and Nathan Woodward, a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, are the driving force of this robotics initiative. Wang, who joined Amassian’s lab in 2018, developed the first iteration of the robotic tools that generate large datasets of solar energy material structure and properties. Woodward, who joined the lab in 2019, has advanced the lab’s capabilities by building robots that make decisions and perform certain tasks autonomously. Woodward’s background in electrical engineering isn’t the only different perspective he brings to the materials science lab. As a person with muscular dystrophy, Woodward has had to tackle the challenges of living in an inaccessible world. “People with disabilities are natural engineers because we have to solve problems every day,” he said. Nathan Woodward holds a microscope chip coated with an experimental solution. In automating their research process, Amassian, Wang, Woodward and the rest of the lab are establishing methods that are less labor-intensive than current practices. Machines complete repetitive tasks the same way each time and log all of the data. That means scientists can spend less time mixing, pipetting, coating and testing and spend more time and energy discovering, problem-solving and innovating. “We’re excited about developing companions that help students and researchers become much more productive in the lab,” Amassian said. “Today, we ask our Ph.D. students and candidates to do a lot of basic handwork, mixing and cleaning, from morning to evening. In the age of data, we increasingly require students to log everything they do into a database, which can be a significant time sink. With automation in the lab, we can take a highly educated, well-trained Ph.D. scientist and use more of their intellect to solve a complex problem instead of these tasks.” The team’s focus on interdisciplinarity is helping its members grow as scientists and engineers. Woodward has studied the intricacies of material processing while developing robotic platforms. Wang has learned more about software and data science in addition to building on his foundation in materials science. Such collaboration can change the landscape of materials research. “The way we think about these problems classically in materials science is to use trial and error,” Wang said. “But since moving toward automation and digitization, we’re starting to use big-picture data science approaches and planning in our research. We can access a larger parameter space easily, and data is available in an instant. Using robotics and artificial intelligence makes it possible to solve more complex problems and helps us move toward smarter lives.” Robots in Amassian’s lab can automatically mix, apply and assess solutions on materials. The lab could have a bigger impact beyond its contributions to materials science and solar energy. Woodward has shown Amassian firsthand the challenges people with physical disabilities face, which extend into research labs. The pair have worked to make Amassian’s lab more accessible, and they hope their efforts using robots in the lab will pave the way for more accessible research opportunities across the board. “There’s a very small number of people with disabilities in STEM to begin with, and that number is even smaller going from undergraduate programs to Ph.D. programs,” Woodward said. “This has the potential for people who have greater physical limitations than I have to pursue fulfilling careers in science.” This post was originally published in NC State News. ; Printing Perovskite Single Crystals for Photonics A new paper co-authored by Tony, a Ph.D. student in MSE, will appear in Advanced Materials(link here), a premier journal in our field. About the Research Prof. Aram Amassian’s group at North Carolina State University has demonstrated a novel strategy for fabricating hybrid perovskite single crystals using a simple drying droplet that may change how semiconductors are manufactured in the future. “Single crystals are the highest quality embodiment of any semiconductor. They contain very few defects and imperfections compared to traditional thin films and significantly outperform these. But only Si, GaAs and a few other semiconductors have single crystal wafers on which to fabricate integrated circuits. Now, we can grow single crystals on glass and other substrates using printing technology”, says Prof. Aram Amassian, corresponding author of the paper on this work. The team made a key innovation in ink formulation and processing, dubbed the “cosolvent evaporation (CSE) strategy”. This uses a cosolvent additive to guarantee the ink produces a single crystal every time it dries without leaving any residue or “coffee ring”. The CSE strategy now makes it possible to print single crystals of almost any known hybrid metal halide perovskite on surfaces, using widely available fabrication methods, making it a universal approach. By applying the CSE strategy, the team demonstrated on-chip fabrication of high-quality microcrystal arrays and single crystal photonic devices, demonstrating the potential for future scalable manufacturing in the context of printed electronics. “By printing specially formulated inks, we can fabricate high-quality single crystal arrays on large area surfaces within minutes all the while doing this in ambient conditions. We foresee future implementation in the area of printed and flexible electronics applications towards IoT and the Trillion Sensors challenge.” The paper “A Universal Cosolvent Evaporation Strategy Enables Direct Printing of Perovskite Single Crystals for Optoelectronic Device Applications”, is published in Advanced Materials ( Co-lead authors are Daniel Corzo, a former MS student in Prof. Amassian’s group at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), and Tonghui (Tony) Wang, a current PhD student in Materials Science and Engineering at NC State University.

There is a growing need, for current and near-future applications, where both high energy and high power densities are required in the same material. Pseudocapacitance, a faradaic process involving surface or near surface redox reactions, offers a means of achieving high energy density at high charge–discharge rates. Here, we focus on the pseudocapacitive properties of transition metal oxides. First, we introduce pseudocapacitance and describe its electrochemical features. Then, we review the most relevant pseudocapacitive materials in aqueous and non-aqueous electrolytes. The major challenges for pseudocapacitive materials along with a future outlook are detailed at the end. ; View article Authors Veronica Augustyn, Jérémy Come, Michael A Lowe, Jong Woung Kim, Pierre-Louis Taberna, Sarah H Tolbert, Héctor D Abruña, Patrice Simon, Bruce Dunn Publisher Nature Publishing Group Description Pseudocapacitance is commonly associated with surface or near-surface reversible redox reactions, as observed with RuO2·xH2O in an acidic electrolyte. However, we recently demonstrated that a pseudocapacitive mechanism occurs when lithium ions are inserted into mesoporous and nanocrystal films of orthorhombic Nb2O5 (T-Nb2O5; refs , ). Here, we quantify the kinetics of charge storage in T-Nb2O5: currents that vary inversely with time, charge-storage capacity that is mostly independent of rate, and redox peaks that exhibit small voltage offsets even at high rates. We also define the structural characteristics necessary for this process, termed intercalation pseudocapacitance, which are a crystalline network that offers two-dimensional transport pathways and little structural change on intercalation. The principal benefit realized from intercalation pseudocapacitance is that high levels of charge storage are … Scholar articles V Augustyn, J Come, MA Lowe, JW Kim, PL Taberna… - Nature materials, 2013 ; View article Authors Simon Fleischmann, James B.

To investigate this strategy, the electrochemical energy storage behavior of a model hydrated layered oxide, WO3·2H2O, is compared with that of anhydrous WO3 in an acidic electrolyte.

Here, we present the discovery that confined interlayer water in crystalline tungsten oxide hydrates, WO3·nH2O, enables highly reversible proton intercalation at subsecond time scales. By comparing the structural transformation kinetics and confined water dynamics of the hydrates with anhydrous WO3, we determine that the rapid electrochemical proton intercalation is due to the ability of the confined water layers to isolate structural transformations to two dimensions while stabilizing the structure along the third dimension. As a result, these water layers provide both structural flexibility and stability to accommodate intercalation-driven bonding changes.

Saldarriaga-Lopez, Xinyi Chen, Laura T. Schelhas, Gary W. Rubloff, Bruce Dunn, Sarah H. Tolbert Journal Advanced Functional Materials Description Solution processing of colloidal nanocrystals into porous architectures using block co‐polymer templating offers a simple yet robust route to construct materials with open porosity and high surface area. These features, when realized in materials that show efficient redox activity and good conductivity, should be ideal for electrochemical energy storage because they allow for efficient electrolyte diffusion and ample surface and near‐surface redox reactions. Here, a route to synthesize nanoporous pseudocapacitors is presented using preformed ITO nanocrystals to make a conductive scaffold, coated with a conformal layer of vanadia deposited using atomic layer deposition (ALD). Two vanadia thicknesses are deposited, 2 and 7 nm, to examine the kinetics of Li+ diffusion into vanadia in a system where all other chemical and structural parameters are fixed. Porosity measurements show that the internal surface area of … Scholar articles IE Rauda, V Augustyn, LC Saldarriaga‐Lopez, X Chen… - Advanced Functional Materials, 2014 ; Materials at electrochemical interfaces for the development of clean-energy technologies The Augustyn Group investigates materials at electrochemical interfaces for the development of clean-energy technologies.

Here, we report an approach to control and switch local ferromagnetism with an electric field using multiferroics. We use two types of electromagnetic coupling phenomenon that are manifested in heterostructures consisting of a ferromagnet in intimate contact with the multiferroic BiFeO3. The first is an internal, magnetoelectric coupling between antiferromagnetism and ferroelectricity in the BiFeO3 film that leads to electric-field control of the antiferromagnetic order. The second is based on exchange interactions at the interface between a ferromagnet (Co0.9Fe0.1) and the antiferromagnet. We have discovered a one-to-one mapping of the ferroelectric and ferromagnetic domains, mediated by the colinear coupling … ; View article Authors Jan Seidel, Lane W Martin, Qili He, Q Zhan, Y-H Chu, A Rother, ME Hawkridge, Peter Maksymovych, P Yu, Martin Gajek, Nina Balke, SV Kalinin, Sibylle Gemming, Fuqiong Wang, G Catalan, JF Scott, NA Spaldin, J Orenstein, Ragashravanthi Ramesh Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Domain walls may play an important role in future electronic devices, given their small size as well as the fact that their location can be controlled. Here, we report the observation of room-temperature electronic conductivity at ferroelectric domain walls in the insulating multiferroic BiFeO3. The origin and nature of the observed conductivity are probed using a combination of conductive atomic force microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and first-principles density functional computations. Our analyses indicate that the conductivity correlates with structurally driven changes in both the electrostatic potential and the local electronic structure, which shows a decrease in the bandgap at the domain wall. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential for device applications of such conducting nanoscale features. ; View article Authors N Balke, S Jesse, AN Morozovska, E Eliseev, DW Chung, Y Kim, L Adamczyk, RE Garcia, N Dudney, SV Kalinin Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK ; View article Authors LW Martin, SP Crane, YH Chu, MB Holcomb, M Gajek, Mark Huijben, Chan-Ho Yang, N Balke, R Ramesh Source Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter ; View article Authors C-H Yang, Jan Seidel, SY Kim, PB Rossen, Pu Yu, Martin Gajek, Ying-Hao Chu, Lane W Martin, MB Holcomb, Q He, Petro Maksymovych, Nina Balke, Sergei V Kalinin, Arthur P Baddorf, SR Basu, ML Scullin, R Ramesh Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Many interesting materials phenomena such as the emergence of high-Tc superconductivity in the cuprates and colossal magnetoresistance in the manganites arise out of a doping-driven competition between energetically similar ground states. Doped multiferroics present a tantalizing evolution of this generic concept of phase competition. Here, we present the observation of an electronic conductor–insulator transition by control of band-filling in the model antiferromagnetic ferroelectric BiFeO3 through Ca doping. Application of electric field enables us to control and manipulate this electronic transition to the extent that a p–n junction can be created, erased and inverted in this material. A ‘dome-like’ feature in the doping dependence of the ferroelectric transition is observed around a Ca concentration of ∼1/8, where a new pseudo-tetragonal phase appears and the electric modulation of conduction is optimized … ; View article Authors Yunzhu Shi, Liam Collins, Rui Feng, Chuan Zhang, Nina Balke, Peter K Liaw, Bin Yang ; View article Authors Nina Balke, Samrat Choudhury, Stephen Jesse, Mark Huijben, Ying Hao Chu, Arthur P Baddorf, Long-Qing Chen, R Ramesh, Sergei V Kalinin Journal Nature nanotechnology Publisher Nature Publishing Group UK Description Multiferroic materials showing coupled electric, magnetic and elastic orderings provide a platform to explore complexity and new paradigms for memory and logic devices. Until now, the deterministic control of non-ferroelectric order parameters in multiferroics has been elusive. Here, we demonstrate deterministic ferroelastic switching in rhombohedral BiFeO3 by domain nucleation with a scanning probe. We are able to select among final states that have the same electrostatic energy, but differ dramatically in elastic or magnetic order, by applying voltage to the probe while it is in lateral motion. We also demonstrate the controlled creation of a ferrotoroidal order parameter. The ability to control local elastic, magnetic and torroidal order parameters with an electric field will make it possible to probe local strain and magnetic ordering, and engineer various magnetoelectric, domain-wall-based and strain-coupled devices.

Here, we explore electronic transport at artificially created ferroelectric vortices in BiFeO3 thin films. The creation of one-dimensional conductive channels activated at voltages as low as 1 V is demonstrated. We study the electronic as well as the static and dynamic polarization structure of several topological defects using a combination of first-principles and phase-field modelling. The modelling predicts that the core structure can undergo a reversible transformation into a metastable twist structure, extending charged domain walls segments through the film thickness. The vortex core is therefore a dynamic conductor controlled by the coupled response of polarization and electron–mobile-vacancy subsystems with external bias … ; View article Authors Nina Balke, Igor Bdikin, Sergei V Kalinin, Andrei L Kholkin Source Journal of the American Ceramic Society Publisher Blackwell Publishing Inc Description Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has emerged as a powerful and versatile tool for probing nanoscale phenomena in ferroelectric materials on the nanometer and micrometer scales.

Probing static and dynamic polarization behavior of individual grains in PZT films and ceramics is discussed. Switching spectroscopy PFM is introduced as a useful tool for studying defects and interfaces in ceramic materials.

In the last 20 years, the development of voltage-modulated scanning probe microscopy techniques, exemplified by Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and associated time-and voltage spectroscopies, opened a pathway to explore these materials on a single-digit nanometer level. Consequently, domain structures and walls and polarization dynamics can now be imaged in real space. More generally, PFM has allowed studying electromechanical coupling in a broad variety of materials ranging from ionics to biological systems. It can also be anticipated that the recent Nobel prize [“The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016,” nobelprize. org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/(Nobel Media, 2016)] in molecular electromechanical machines will result in rapid growth in … Scholar articles RK Vasudevan, N Balke, P Maksymovych, S Jesse… - Applied Physics Reviews, 2017 ; View article Authors HW Jang, Amit Kumar, Sava Denev, Michael D Biegalski, Petro Maksymovych, CW Bark, Craig T Nelson, CM Folkman, Seung Hyub Baek, Nina Balke, Charles M Brooks, Demetri A Tenne, DG Schlom, Long-Qing Chen, XQ Pan, Sergei V Kalinin, <? format?> V Gopalan, CB Eom Publisher American Physical Society Description Biaxial strain is known to induce ferroelectricity in thin films of nominally nonferroelectric materials such as . By a direct comparison of the strained and strain-free films using dielectric, ferroelectric, Raman, nonlinear optical and nanoscale piezoelectric property measurements, we conclude that all films and bulk crystals are relaxor ferroelectrics, and the role of strain is to stabilize longer-range correlation of preexisting nanopolar regions, likely originating from minute amounts of unintentional Sr deficiency in nominally stoichiometric samples. These findings highlight the sensitive role of stoichiometry when exploring strain and epitaxy-induced electronic phenomena in oxide films, heterostructures, and interfaces. ; View article Authors Nina Balke, Petro Maksymovych, Stephen Jesse, Andreas Herklotz, Alexander Tselev, Chang-Beom Eom, Ivan I Kravchenko, Pu Yu, Sergei V Kalinin Publisher American Chemical Society ; View article Authors Nina Balke, Stephen Jesse, Yoongu Kim, Leslie Adamczyk, Alexander Tselev, Ilia N Ivanov, Nancy J Dudney, Sergei V Kalinin Publisher American Chemical Society ; View article Authors Wenbin Wang, Jun Zhao, Wenbo Wang, Zheng Gai, Nina Balke, Miaofang Chi, Ho Nyung Lee, Wei Tian, Leyi Zhu, Xuemei Cheng, David J Keavney, Jieyu Yi, Thomas Z Ward, Paul C Snijders, Hans M Christen, Weida Wu, Jian Shen, Xiaoshan Xu Publisher American Physical Society Description The crystal and magnetic structures of single-crystalline hexagonal films have been studied using x-ray, electron, and neutron diffraction methods. The polar structure of these films are found to persist up to 1050 K; and the switchability of the polar behavior is observed at room temperature, indicating ferroelectricity. An antiferromagnetic order was shown to occur below 440 K, followed by a spin reorientation resulting in a weak ferromagnetic order below 130 K. This observation of coexisting multiple ferroic orders demonstrates that hexagonal films are room-temperature multiferroics. ; Nina Balke (0000-0001-5865-5892) - ORCID North Carolina State University: Raleigh, North Carolina, US 2021 to present | Associate Professor (Materials Science and Engineering) Employment Source: Nina Balke Oak Ridge National Laboratory: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, US 2010 to 2021 | Research & Development Staff Scientist (Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences) Employment Source: Nina Balke Oak Ridge National Laboratory: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, US 2008 to 2010 | Feodor Lynen Research Fellow (Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences) Employment Source: Nina Balke University of California at Berkeley: Berkeley, California, US 2007 to 2008 | Feodor Lynen Research Fellow (Materials Science) Employment Source: Nina Balke Technical University of Darmstadt: Darmstadt, Hesse, DE 2006 to 2007 | Postdoc (Materials Science) Employment Source: Nina Balke Technical University of Darmstadt: Darmstadt, Hesse, DE 2003 to 2006 | PhD (Materials Science) Education Source: Nina Balke Technical University of Darmstadt: Darmstadt, Hesse, DE 1998 to 2003 | Diploma (MS equivalent) (Materials Science) Education Source: Nina Balke Oak Ridge National Laboratory: Oak Ridge, Tennessee, US 2025 to present | Member of User Executive Committee (Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences ) Service Source: Nina Balke Elsevier BV (Netherlands): Amsterdam, North Holland, NL 2023 to present | Associate editor (Energy Storage Materials ) Invited position Source: Nina Balke Wiley: Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, DE 2022 to present | Member of the Editorial Advisory Board (Electrochemical Science Advances) Invited position Source: Nina Balke Materials Research Society: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, US 2020 to present | MRS Postdoctoral Award subcommittee (Awards) Service Source: Nina Balke Gordon Research Conferences: Kingston, Rhode Island, US 2018 to 2018 | Chair (Gordon Research Conference on Batteries) Service Source: Nina Balke NATURE COMMUNICATIONS 2025 | Journal article | Author Contributors: Reza Ghanbari; K.

Here we report a combination of density functional theory calculations, quantum molecular dynamics simulations and variable-temperature, -pressure and -bias piezoresponse force microscopy data to predict and verify the existence of an unusual ferroelectric property—a uniaxial quadruple potential well for Cu displacements—enabled by the van der Waals gap in copper indium thiophosphate (CuInP2S6). The calculated potential energy landscape for Cu displacements is strongly influenced by strain, accounting for the origin of the negative piezoelectric coefficient and rendering CuInP2S6 a rare example of a uniaxial multi-well ferroelectric.

Materials based on Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3 exhibit high strains mediated by a field‐induced phase transition. Using the band excitation technique the initial domain morphology, the poling behavior, the switching behavior, and the time‐dependent phase stability in the pseudo‐ternary system (1–x)(0.94Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3‐0.06BaTiO3)‐xK0.5Na0.5NbO3 (0 <= x <= 18 mol%) are revealed. In the base material (x = 0 mol%), macroscopic domains and ferroelectric switching can be induced from the initial relaxor state with sufficiently high electric field, yielding large macroscopic remanent strain and polarization. The addition of KNN increases the threshold field required to induce long range order and decreases the stability thereof.

Surface topography changes on the micro/sub-micro scale are monitored at different applied anodizing potentials in a 3.5 wt% NaCl solution. The microstructural evolutions with the increased Al content in the alloys are characterized by SEM, TEM, EDS and EBSD. The results show that by increasing the Al content, the microstructure changes from single solid-solution to multi-phases, leading to the segregations of elements. Due to the microstructural variations in the AlxCoCrFeNi HEAs, localized corrosion processes in different ways after the breakdown of the passive film, which changes from pitting to phase boundary corrosion. The XPS results indicate that an increased Al content in the alloys/phases corresponds to a decreased corrosion resistance of the surface passive film.

By combining advanced atomic force microscopy (AFM) with multi-modal characterization, our team connects fundamental nanoscale processes to macroscopic material performance in energy and information technologies. Coupling and Control Over Polar Properties The Balke Lab studies how polarization in materials can be controlled and transformed to enable new functionality in energy and information technologies. By applying electric fields, researchers explore complex dielectric behaviors in materials such as ferroelectrics, relaxors, and antiferroelectrics, including transitions between states that typically do not coexist. Of particular interest are out-of-equilibrium polar phases at interfaces, the role of ionic defects in shaping extrinsic properties, and the coupling of intrinsic and extrinsic polarization. Using advanced AFM techniques, the lab quantifies nanoscale polar properties, such as piezoelectric constants, and connects these insights to theory to discover and design new material behaviors. Polarization of materials is at the heart of many applications in energy and information technology, often based on the possibility of controlling polarization through externally applied forces. The action of an electric field, in particular, enacts both linear and non-linear dielectric responses, creating a rich phenomenology of dipolar glasses, paraelectrics, relaxors, antiferroelectrics, and ferroelectrics. New and unexpected properties can emerge through the coupling of or transition between distinct polar behaviors, including the possibility of changing polar material properties on demand between states of materials that typically do not coexist. One way to realize this is the stabilization of out-of-equilibrium polar phases, often confined to interfaces or surfaces due to broken symmetry, but which are topologically protected. Of fundamental interest are not only intrinsic but also extrinsic polar phenomena, which are associated with polar properties introduced by ionic defects, which can be controlled via chemical modification routes. The project goal can only be achieved through the fundamental understanding of polar properties and how to transform them on multiple length scales, from the atomic to micrometer scale properties, which require the development of new probing methodologies and integrated microscopic approaches. Specifically, this includes (a) polar transitions based on order-disorder phenomena in ferroelectric ion conductors such as CuInP2S6, (b) the coupling of intrinsic and extrinsic polar properties, for example, the coupling of intrinsic polarization with oxygen vacancies, and (c) the creation of new functionality at boundaries of dissimilar polar properties. The discovery of new phenomena is enabled through the quantification of AFM measurables and the extraction of polar material properties, for example, the piezoelectric constant, to allow for integration with theory. Highlights Piezoresponse force microscopy detects the co-existence of multiple polarization states in van-der-Waals layered CuInP2S6 based on quantification of local piezoelectric responses and comparison with theory.

Local Insights Into Electrochemical Processes Electrochemically induced ion insertion underpins energy storage devices such as batteries, capacitors and pseudocapacitors, as well as electrochemical actuators, neuromorphic computing and desalination, where electrodes experience significant volume changes due to electro-chemo-mechanical coupling. Understanding how electrode mechanics correlate with electrochemical performance and charge storage is critical for advancing these technologies. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) enables in-situ tracking of local volume and stiffness changes at the grain level, offering insights beyond current-based methods and contributing to a library of strain-charge coupling phenomena across materials. This research focuses on electrode responses to electric double layer formation, surface and bulk redox processes, with particular emphasis on layered materials that combine fast ionic transport, tunable interlayer spacing and mechanical resilience, allowing current-strain coupling to be mapped and compared with complementary in-situ X-ray studies. Electrochemically induced ion insertion is the key phenomenon involved not only in different electrochemical energy storage devices, including batteries, electrochemical double-layer capacitors, and pseudocapacitors, but also in electrochemical actuators, neuromorphic computing, and electrochemical water desalination. The ion-hosting electrode most often undergoes significant volume changes driven by Coulomb interactions, bond length changes, or phase changes, which is described as electro-chemo-mechanical coupling. Understanding the mechanical response of an electrode during electrochemical cycling and its correlation to the device’s electrochemical performance and stored charge is crucial to improving the performance of insertion-type energy storage devices, electrochemical actuators, water purification, ion separation, and neuromorphic computing applications. AFMs can be used to track local volume changes in situ and can, therefore, be used to study local electrochemical processes on the level of single grains or electrode components, which is not possible with current-based characterization techniques. One of the goals of this research direction is to build a library of strain-charge coupling phenomena for different electrochemical energy storage devices and explore the consequences of local heterogeneity of electro-chemo-mechanical on electrochemical performances and local ionic transport. Specifically, electrode volume changes and stiffness changes as a result of (a) electric double layer formation, as well as (b) surface and (c) bulk redox processes, are investigated. Of high interest are layered electrode materials since they allow for fast ionic transport, have an interlayer space that can be modified, and typically accommodate strain without mechanical degradation, such as crack formation. Using an AFM, local current-strain coupling coefficients can be identified and correlated with information about individual grain orientation and can be directly compared to in-situ X-ray studies, which track the volume changes on the unit cell level.

Solid-Liquid Interface-Driven Functionality The structure of electrical double layers (EDLs) at electrified interfaces plays a critical role in electrochemical energy storage and emerging devices such as ion-gated transistors, with ionic liquids (ILs) offering wide electrochemical windows and high charge density for tuning metal oxide properties through electrostatic doping or vacancy modification. However, links between molecular-scale EDL structure and device-level behavior remain limited, particularly regarding ion layering defects that influence charge storage and gating. Atomic force microscopy (AFM), sensitive to density variations near interfaces, enables three-dimensional mapping of EDLs under operating conditions, connecting nanoscale processes to macroscopic performance. This approach also extends to modifying polar materials like ferroelectrics via solid-liquid interfaces, leveraging liquid environments for electrochemical control of surface chemistry, screening mechanisms, and order parameter tuning, while AFM in liquid further allows direct study of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. The structure of electrical double layers (EDL) at electrified interfaces is of utmost importance for electrochemical energy storage as well as printable, flexible, and bio-electronic devices, such as ion-gated transistors. Ionic liquids (IL) have attracted considerable attention not only due to their large electrochemical window but also due to the high energy charge density they can provide. This is, for example, used to modify the current-voltage characteristics of metal oxides due to electrostatic doping or modification of oxygen vacancy concentrations. While this is explored on the device level, connections to the molecular-level structure of the EDL are largely missing. An important consideration is the existence of defects in the ion layering observed in the EDL of IL and its consequences for charge storage or gating properties. Since an AFM probe is sensitive to the mass density changes when approaching the solid interface inside the liquid, this approach can be used to image the EDL structure and map it in three dimensions under in situ operation of electrochemical capacitors or gated transistors. This approach shines a light on the correlation of molecular length scale processes and the macroscopically measured device performance. This concept can be expanded to use solid-liquid interfaces to modify polar materials and their functionality. The use of a liquid provides a well-defined chemical potential at the solid-liquid interface, which can provide additional screening mechanisms for polar materials, such as ferroelectrics. The use of a liquid has the advantage of electrochemical control of surface chemistry and thus order parameter tuning. Since AFM can be used to study piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties in liquid, this platform offers a unique opportunity to link the interfacial structure of the liquid and underlying polar properties..

This will be enabled using 3D analysis of the microstructure using advanced focused ion beam and tomography methods as well as Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) techniques. The use of AFM has been successfully applied by co-PI Balke to reveal the local effects of bipolar fatigue in polished cross-section PZT ceramics [1]. In combination, this multi-modal approach covers many relevant length scales and will generate comprehensive insights into the mechanical and functional degradation throughout the thickness of bulk ceramics and will be applied to time and field-driven degradation relevant to actuator applications, such as aging and unipolar fatigue. This will allow to directly identify areas which are most affected by degradation, such as electrode-near regions, and identify their consequences on local and global piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. Specifically, we will use (1) plasma Focused Ion Beam (pFIB) to rapidly characterize large blocks of fatigued regions both near the surface and in the bulk, (2) X-ray Nano-computed tomography (nano-CT) to identify the presence and location of internal microcracks, and (3) Piezoresponse Force Microscopy (PFM) to characterize the change in local domain structure, domain wall mobility, as well as qualitative changes in dielectric constant throughout the sample thickness. All local observables will be directly compared to macroscopically measured effects of degradation, such as strain and polarization to bridge the information obtained on different length scales and to explore the origin of degradation in the context of unifying degradation laws. This information will allow to establish the role of the microstructure and electrode/ceramic interface on reliability and lifetime predictions. Machine Learning Methods for Microscopy Data Analytics (Jacob Smith) Date: 01/03/22 - 12/29/23 Amount: $117,319.00 Funding Agencies: US Dept. of Energy (DOE) The critical role of catalysts in supporting advanced industries and technologies cannot be overstated. From nitrogen fixation to petroleum cracking, even a moderate improvement in catalyst efficiency can result in monumental energy and monetary savings. As the state of the art develops, so does the complexity of these catalysts and their manufacturing processes. Although nanoparticle catalysts are still prevalent, nanoparticle or single atom catalysts bound to non-catalytic material to modify their properties has become the topic of much research. These have often taken the form of platinum affixed to substrates such as ceria or alumina. However, the introduction of a support structure, and a corresponding interface, increases the complex nature of the manufacturing environment. Therefore, to control the resulting catalyst morphology and active sites, it is necessary to understand the reaction pathways that connect the chemical precursor to the final product and determine how the introduction of a compatible substrate affects catalyst nucleation and growth. Historically, efforts to research catalytic reaction paths have been performed on large sample volumes using various in situ diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. In this manner, it is possible to generally determine what phases and oxidation states are involved in the process. However, such techniques are not ideal for delving into the highly localized and non-uniform reactions that occur in the angstrom scale environment of nanoparticle nucleation and growth at an interface. For this reason, alternate techniques based on transmission electron microscopy (TEM) have been employed successfully to observe nanoparticle synthesis at atomic resolution in a variety of operant environments. However, to date, few TEM studies have successfully imaged the intermediate steps required to reduce a catalyst������������������s chemical precursor into a metallic state and thereby understand its nucleation and growth processes. In large part, this has been a consequence of the commonly used liquid phase in situ environment that renders solute chemical imaging impossible. Here we proposed to use atomic resolution, in situ TEM to study the effect of environmental variables in the manufacturing of catalytic nanoparticles from a solid state precursor. The chief system of interest will be that of platinum������������������s chemical precursors with a range of inert substrates. Initial steps toward the accomplishment of this goal have already been taken to great success. By using a combination of low dose HAADF and iDPC, it has been revealed that initial nucleation of platinum metal from potassium tetrachloroplatinate can occur from a disproportionation reaction. This has demonstrated that the concept is technologically sound and may be reproduced on more complex systems to gauge the effect of substrate-rich environments. o overcome this impediment, machine learning based compressive sensing will be developed to reconstruct the images from a limited signal. In this manner, the time resolution of the image series will be substantially improved without sacrificing interpretability.

Kara Krogh’s Journey to MSE: From Middle School Inspiration to Nuclear Materials Specialist Kara’s path to Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) began in a middle school classroom, where a project on college majors introduced her to the field. “I thought it was a really interesting field, and it fits with my love of chemistry,” Kara explained. As she continued her education, her passion for MSE only grew. In high school, she was introduced to a senior MSE student at NC State, who gave her a tour of the campus and the undergraduate labs in Engineering Building 1 (EB1). After that visit, Kara knew MSE was the path she wanted to follow. Initially, Kara had envisioned working in biodegradable plastics and sustainable materials. However, after taking the Introduction to MSE course, she discovered a deeper fascination with metals. “This led me to nuclear materials, where I found my passion for materials analysis,” she said. “The MSE department at NC State has a close-knit community, and I’ve made amazing friends throughout my time here.” Kara Krogh ’25 Her time at NC State’s MSE department has been filled with both academic growth and extracurricular involvement. Kara particularly enjoyed her classes, especially the introductory MSE course taught by Dr. Irving. “He made the class so fun with his stories, jokes, and demonstrations,” Kara recalled. Other favorite classes included Kinetics with Dr. Augustyn, Nuclear Materials with Dr. He, and Mechanics of Materials with Dr. Balke. Beyond the classroom, Kara has been an active volunteer for the department’s presence at the College of Engineering Open House since her sophomore year, where she’s had the opportunity to share her passion for MSE with prospective students. “The MSE department at NC State has a close-knit community, and I’ve made amazing friends throughout my time here,” she said. Looking to the future, Kara is excited to apply her MSE education in the professional world. She has secured a position as a Mechanical Properties Technical Specialist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) after graduation. “I’m excited to put my knowledge and research skills into practice and develop new skills as I grow in this position,” Kara said. Her job will involve working with a variety of metals for nuclear applications and performing mechanical testing and analysis. Outside of her academic and professional pursuits, Kara is an avid hiker and mountaineer. She has hiked to the highest point in 44 states and is working toward her goal of summiting the highest peak in all 50 states. “The three peaks I’m most proud of are Mt. Hood in Oregon, Granite Peak in Montana, and Borah Peak in Idaho,” she said. “Each hike had its own challenges, and they’ve built my confidence for future hikes.” In addition to her outdoor adventures, Kara also enjoys attending NC State sports events. Her favorite memory is attending the women’s basketball Play for Kay game against Duke. “I love the atmosphere of the women’s basketball games and being able to go with friends to root for the Wolfpack,” she shared. Reflecting on her time in MSE, Kara appreciates the versatility of the field. “It’s so important to understand materials, no matter what field you go into,” she said. “Now that I’m concluding my undergraduate career, I have a much greater appreciation for MSE as a whole.” Kara’s journey from middle school discovery to pursuing a career in nuclear materials analysis is a testament to her passion for learning and problem-solving, and her future in MSE looks brighter than ever.

Together, they explored the structure and chemistry of a CPU using various characterization methods at AIF, guided by lab managers who provided expert training and mentorship. Anna Lumpkin, AIF’s university program specialist, interviewed both teachers about their experience with the program and what excites them about the research. — What was your overall experience working in the lab during the RET program? Julianna: My overall experience was very positive, Dr. Balke had a very structured approach to getting us as much instrument time as possible. Jose: I thoroughly enjoyed all of the lab experience, and the time each lab manager was very helpful, receptive, and heartwarming. I would’ve enjoyed spending a little more committed time with the SEM and TEM looking over different samples. Was there a specific moment or project that really stood out to you during your time in the lab? Why was it meaningful or memorable? Julianna: I enjoyed working with the SEM and TEM instruments. We were able to get a very hands-on experience with the SEM and TEM getting to control the instrument and collect our own data. Jose: I enjoyed our time looking through the different Chemical compositions for our sample(s). I think it would’ve been nice to look over other electronic components under the SEM. It was great working with Chuck because he really took his time out of his busy schedule to walk us through the SEM and made sure we were able to maneuver the SEM on our own. How comfortable did you feel learning and using new tools or instruments? What kind of support or training helped the most? Julianna: Very comfortable, everyone was very thorough in explaining how the instruments worked and how to operate them and were very receptive to any questions we had. I really liked how with the SEM training Chuck had some background resources in the form of a slide show that he was able to reference back to for more complex topics. Jose: On a scale of 1-10, I feel as though I was on a 7 with most of the instruments. I think the breakdown that Roberto, Chuck, and Chris gave us made it easier for us to learn. How will you translate your research experience into something you can bring back to your students? Julianna: I teach force, motion and energy units as part of the 7th grade science curriculum and can relate the real world technology to my lessons so my students can see applications of those concepts. Jose: I would incorporate some type of research experience where my students research different nano techniques and then design an instrument that could be associated with the instrument of choice. What was it like working with the research team and mentors during the program? How would you describe the lab environment? Julianna: Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Questions were encouraged and the team was happy to give answers and clarifications to anything asked. The lab environment was very well organized and very welcoming. Jose: It was an amazing time, I was able to work with very knowledgeable people and get to know about some of the other research projects going on at AIF. The lab environment was very welcoming and warm. Almost like one of those sitcom teams where everyone gets along and they all have different personalities that make AIF as pleasant and fun as it is. What was the most valuable part of the RET experience for you personally or professionally? Julianna: Getting more exposure to real world applications for physics. Jose: Professionally, it was amazing meeting other educators and researchers who are changing the world by asking simple questions and then taking them to another level of science. Were there any unexpected challenges during the program? How did you work through them? Julianna: Not particularly, I did need some background on the background info at times but the team was very good about providing additional clarifications and information when needed. Jose: There were a lot of times when I felt overwhelmed by the amount of information being processed at one time, but the staff was very understanding and made us aware that they could slow down if needed. I took my time and just took bits and chunks of information down at a time in order not to overwhelm myself. The lab environment was very welcoming and warm. Almost like one of those sitcom teams where everyone gets along and they all have different personalities that make AIF as pleasant and fun as it is. – Jose Acosta Would you recommend this experience to other teachers? Julianna: Yes, I would definitely recommend it. It was a great experience and I got to see and learn about some fantastic real world applications of some of the concepts and topics I teach. Jose: I would recommend my fellow teachers to do an RET because of the amount of support, learning, and fun they’ll have in the lab. The RET program offers educators a unique opportunity to explore nanoscale science firsthand, deepen their technical skills, and bring that knowledge back to inspire the next generation of scientists. Julianna and Jose’s summer in the lab shows how hands-on research can bridge the gap between the classroom and cutting-edge science.

Benjamin Finley Trades Chemical Engineering for Materials Science Benjamin Finley’s path to Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) at NC State University was not a straightforward one, but it led him to a fulfilling and exciting future. Originally, Finley came to NC State with a general interest in engineering, but it wasn’t until he took CH 101 that he discovered his passion for chemistry. “I enjoyed CH 101 far more than any of my peers,” said Finley. This newfound interest led him to pursue Chemical Engineering, but after a few semesters, he realized his true passion lay elsewhere. “I wanted to gain a fundamental understanding of the world around me through daily interactions, and Chemical Engineering mainly focused on molecules in solutions and powders. Most of what I interacted with were solid materials,” Finley explained. This realization prompted him to switch his focus to Materials Science and Engineering, a decision he is glad he made. “Everything is materials! Any industry that makes a physical product needs Materials Science Engineers.” Ben Finley ’25 Finley’s time in MSE was filled with challenges and valuable learning experiences. He credits the multidisciplinary nature of the major for keeping things both diverse and engaging. “The material has as much breadth as it has depth. It always felt like I was learning radically new things,” said Finley. He expressed his gratitude toward professors like Dr. Irving, Dr. Augustyn, and Dr. Balke for their guidance through tough subjects such as Thermodynamics, Kinetics, and Mechanics. He also appreciates the support of Hillary Stone, his academic advisor, for helping him navigate his academic journey. Looking ahead, Finley is eager to continue his career in Materials Science. He recently accepted an offer to join the Ph.D. program at the University of Utah, where he will research carbon fiber recycling. “I’m very excited about the program and hope to turn this research experience into a career as either a researcher or a professor,” he shared. One of Finley’s accomplishments is his recent summer project at the University of Utah, where he studied the interactions between microplastics and PFAS. He was responsible for conducting self-directed research and using a variety of unfamiliar machines and techniques. His findings, which included evidence of agglomeration between microplastics and PFAS, are now being published in a paper. “It was the most self-directed research I’d ever done, and I’m very proud of the results,” said Finley. For Finley, the coolest thing about Materials Science is its broad applicability. “Everything is materials! Any industry that makes a physical product needs Materials Science Engineers,” he said. This has allowed him to gain knowledge in nearly every engineering discipline, making him feel well-rounded as he looks toward his future. Finley made lasting memories with the NC State Ski and Snowboard Club when he wasn’t immersed in his studies. “The snow days on campus were an absolute blast. Every time it snows, we set up a ramp on the Court of Carolina and take turns jumping off,” Finley fondly remembered. As he takes the next step toward his Ph.D., Finley’s journey from chemical engineering to materials science reflects his growing passion for understanding the world through the lens of materials. His future in this field is only just beginning. Ben jumping really high on a big ski jump at the Court of Carolina, Raleigh, NC, 2025. MSE 100-Year Celebration Student Social, 2024.

The award ceremony, scheduled for April 29 at the Park Alumni Center, will recognize RTNN’s outstanding contributions to nanotechnology research, education, and community engagement. ; AIF User Spotlight | Balke Research Lab Huimin Qiao is currently a postdoctoral research scholar in Nina Balke’s Group within the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at NC State University. Her primary research focuses on nanoscale characterization using atomic force microscopy, particularly exploring the multi-physical fields coupling in ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials, along with their degradation mechanisms. She’s passionate about advancing her career in the field of ferroelectrics and atomic force microscopy. She enjoys hiking, traveling, photography, cooking, gardening, and spending quality time with her cat, Bear. What instruments are you using for your research? Lately, I have been extensively utilizing the Helio 5 Hydra DualBeam – Plasma Focus Ion Beam for microscale cutting tasks. Additionally, I am proficient in operating the Bruker Hysitron TI980 for nanoindentation, the Zeiss XRM Nano CT for 3D imaging, Keyence instruments for height profile characterization, as well as Raman Confocal and ToF-SIMS for chemical imaging. I am also experienced in utilizing SEM and EDS for imaging cross-sections and determining chemical compositions of samples. My approach involves employing a range of instruments to gain comprehensive insights into my samples from various perspectives. How is your research impacting the community? I utilize atomic force microscopy to investigate the physical properties of piezoelectric, ferroelectric, and dielectric materials, focusing on their local-scale coupling. Piezoelectricity, an electromechanical effect where mechanical force generates charges and vice versa, is crucial in electronic devices as transducers, actuators, and sensors. However, cyclic electric fields can degrade ferroelectric performance, impacting device endurance and reliability. Understanding the degradation mechanism in ferroelectrics is a pivotal challenge, exacerbated by the miniaturization of electronic devices. In my research, I employ atomic force microscopy, specifically piezoresponse force microscopy, to examine static and dynamic piezoelectric properties at nano scales. 3D image of a wedge-shaped structure prepared on a chip captured with Keyence I utilize pFIB to create wedge-shaped structures in ferroelectric materials embedded in commercial chips, with Keyence used for viewing shape and height profiles. SEM and EDS provide insights into chip layering and elemental distribution relevant to ferroelectric properties, while nano CT identifies micro cracks and defects. Our aim is to elucidate degradation mechanisms across various ferroelectric materials from local to macroscopic scales. Our objective is to understand the mechanisms governing transitions between these polar states and to manipulate them for future nanodevice applications. – Huimin Qiao Additionally, I investigate phase transitions in 2D ferroelectric materials. These materials exhibit robust ferroelectricity at single-layer thickness, making them promising for electronic nanodevices. Transition metal thio phosphates (TMTPs) are particularly intriguing due to their negative piezoelectricity and multiple polar states (high polarization, low polarization, antiferroelectric). What have you learned from your experience at AIF? Understanding the workings of an instrument is more crucial than mere operational knowledge. Best thing about AIF in 5 words or less? Great facilities and knowledgeable staff. Is there a staff member at AIF that has helped you? I am grateful to the AIF staff for their kindness, helpfulness, knowledge, and support. I would like to specifically thank Roberto Garcia for his valuable help. I also appreciate Toby Tung, Ruksana Baby, Elaine Zhou, and Chuck Mooney for their assistance in training and answering my questions.

The Research Triangle Nanotechnology Network (RTNN) has been honored with the prestigious 2024 Opal Mann Green Engagement and Scholarship Award at NC State University. The award ceremony, scheduled for April 29 at the Park Alumni Center, will recognize RTNN’s outstanding contributions to nanotechnology research, education, and community engagement. The Opal Mann Award, established in 2010 to honor the leadership of former NC State faculty member Dr. Opal Mann Green, is given annually to recognize a team dedicated to using democracy in the classroom, community, and at home; creating inclusionary teams; and community-based learning around local issues. Founded on the principles of the Kellogg Commission Engagement Seven-Part Test, RTNN emerged from collaborative efforts between NC State University, Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill in response to a National Science Foundation (NSF) call for proposals in 2014. Instead of competing individually, these institutions united to create a collaborative “Site” within the national university nanotechnology network, demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity and responsiveness to national needs. The NC State Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is well represented in RTNN. Led by Kobe Steel Distinguished Professor Jacob Jones, Professor Nina Balke, and Phillip Strader, RTNN’s collaborative approach allows for comprehensive resources that support diverse areas of nanotechnology research, including microelectronics, quantum materials, fiber and textile science, agriculture, and social science. Unlike other sites with specialized focuses, RTNN’s broad capabilities cater to both traditional and non-traditional nano-researchers. In addition to MSE, the project is highly collaborative and interdisciplinary, extending across the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Education, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the NC State Core Facilities including the Analytical Instrumentation Facility (AIF), NC State Nanofabrication Facility (NNF), Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill. “This award means so much to us,’” said Jones. “Of any awards we could receive, we are so excited and incredibly proud and honored to receive this particular award. There are many awards for research and education, but fewer for engagement. Yet engagement is so critical to the university. The team award is based on values that we take to heart— democracy in the community, inclusionary teams, and community-based learning. Over the past eight years, in all of the RTNN’s engagement activities, we’ve reached diverse and broad audiences with desktop electron microscopes and demonstrations, a massive open online course on nanotechnology, educating teachers in nanotechnology research during the summer, and interviewing and conducting social science research on external users (e.g., industry users of university facilities).” “Of any awards we could receive, we are so excited and incredibly proud and honored to receive this particular award. There are many awards for research and education, but fewer for engagement. Yet engagement is so critical to the university.” Jacob Jones The network’s goals center on enhancing accessibility to nanotechnology resources by lowering barriers such as distance, cost, and awareness. Through educational outreach programs, RTNN prepares students for STEM careers, hosts training workshops, and serves as a hub for nanotechnology networking. RTNN serves as a portal to physical resources in the Research Triangle and intellectual resources by leveraging the expertise of more than 100 principal faculty and over 45 technical staff members across three constituent universities and nine core-shared user facilities. RTNN’s impact extends beyond research facilities. The network collaborates with community colleges, museums, and libraries to promote awareness and engagement with nanotechnology. Programs like the RTNN Kickstarter Program and “Nanotechnology, A Maker’s Course” on Coursera aim to educate and attract new users by offering initial free access and online courses. RTNN trains high-quality leaders in many ways. The annual Research Experience for Teachers takes place every summer and is aimed at continuing education for middle and high school teachers as well as community college instructors. Also during the summer is the Research Experience for Undergraduates, where selected students from all over the country participate in a 12-week program allowing them access to facilities and labs at NC State, Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill. In addition to its educational efforts, RTNN conducts social science research to improve user experiences and inform program development. The network’s commitment to engagement is evident in initiatives like the Community College Internship Program, which provides laboratory experience to community college students seeking to transfer to RTNN institutions. RTNN’s innovative programs and partnerships exemplify a commitment to democratizing university resources and advancing nanotechnology education and research. The Opal Mann Green Engagement and Scholarship Award recognizes RTNN’s exceptional contributions to the field and its dedication to fostering collaboration and accessibility in nanotechnology. ———— The annual Opal Green Awards will open for 2025 nominations later this year.

Welcome to the group! ; The AIF is Hiring! | Balke Research Lab Attention all undergrads at NC State University! Our facility is looking to hire an undergraduate student who would like to work with our staff and instruments. We’re specifically looking for those that are interested in learning about X-ray Tomography but are open to hiring for our other instruments as well. If you’d like to apply, please email our director, Nina Balke, at ninabalke@ncsu.edu and attach your resume. An Interview with a Former Undergraduate Worker Leah Bellcase worked as an undergraduate student at the AIF last year. We sat down with her to ask her a few questions about her experience. What were your responsibilities while working at AIF? While working at the AIF I had duties to help maintain a safe and functioning XRD lab alongside lab manager Dr. Forrester. I was trained in the operation of the X-ray diffractometers and helped the users of the facility. Some of my responsibilities included instrument maintenance checks and helping users if the instruments reached any errors during data collection. I also assisted users in training sessions as they learned to use the XRD and analyze data. Other responsibilities included cleaning and organizing the lab and restocking supplies when running low. What were your 3 favorite things while you were working here? One of my favorite things about the job included hearing about a wide range of research projects from departments across NC State, as well as projects from industry and other universities. Another favorite thing of mine was the amount of knowledge I gained from this experience along with applying the knowledge I had learned in the classroom. This experience has taught me how to work alongside a wide range of people, from undergraduate students to Ph.D. candidates to industry professionals. I learned many things that will help me with my future career goals including what it takes to keep a lab running, how to improve my professional communication, and how to upkeep safety measures. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your experience working with the facility and staff? On a scale of 1 to 10, I would rate working with the faculty and staff at a 9. The staff at AIF were so welcoming to me when I first started my position and were always there to help me learn along the way and answer any questions I may have had. While working at AIF not only did I learn about XRD techniques but I learned so much about the other instrumentation available such as SEM, ToF-SIMS, TEM, XPS, and more.

The award ceremony, scheduled for April 29 at the Park Alumni Center, will recognize RTNN’s outstanding contributions to nanotechnology research, education, and community engagement. The Opal Mann Award, established in 2010 to honor the leadership of former NC State faculty member Dr. Opal Mann Green, is given annually to recognize a team dedicated to using democracy in the classroom, community, and at home; creating inclusionary teams; and community-based learning around local issues. Founded on the principles of the Kellogg Commission Engagement Seven-Part Test, RTNN emerged from collaborative efforts between NC State University, Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill in response to a National Science Foundation (NSF) call for proposals in 2014. Instead of competing individually, these institutions united to create a collaborative “Site” within the national university nanotechnology network, demonstrating a commitment to inclusivity and responsiveness to national needs. The NC State Department of Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) is well represented in RTNN. Led by Kobe Steel Distinguished Professor Jacob Jones, Professor Nina Balke, and Philip Strader, RTNN’s collaborative approach allows for comprehensive resources that support diverse areas of nanotechnology research, including microelectronics, quantum materials, fiber and textile science, agriculture, and social science. Unlike other sites with specialized focuses, RTNN’s broad capabilities cater to both traditional and non-traditional nano-researchers. In addition to MSE, the project is highly collaborative and interdisciplinary, extending across the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Education, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the NC State Core Facilities including the Analytical Instrumentation Facility (AIF), NC State Nanofabrication Facility (NNF), Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill. “This award means so much to us,’” said Jones. “Of any awards we could receive, we are so excited and incredibly proud and honored to receive this particular award. There are many awards for research and education, but fewer for engagement. Yet engagement is so critical to the university. The team award is based on values that we take to heart— democracy in the community, inclusionary teams, and community-based learning. Over the past eight years, in all of the RTNN’s engagement activities, we’ve reached diverse and broad audiences with desktop electron microscopes and demonstrations, a massive open online course on nanotechnology, educating teachers in nanotechnology research during the summer, and interviewing and conducting social science research on external users (e.g., industry users of university facilities).” “Of any awards we could receive, we are so excited and incredibly proud and honored to receive this particular award. There are many awards for research and education, but fewer for engagement. Yet engagement is so critical to the university.” Jacob Jones The network’s goals center on enhancing accessibility to nanotechnology resources by lowering barriers such as distance, cost, and awareness. Through educational outreach programs, RTNN prepares students for STEM careers, hosts training workshops, and serves as a hub for nanotechnology networking. RTNN serves as a portal to physical resources in the Research Triangle and intellectual resources by leveraging the expertise of more than 100 principal faculty and over 45 technical staff members across three constituent universities and nine core-shared user facilities. RTNN’s impact extends beyond research facilities. The network collaborates with community colleges, museums, and libraries to promote awareness and engagement with nanotechnology. Programs like the RTNN Kickstarter Program and “Nanotechnology, A Maker’s Course” on Coursera aim to educate and attract new users by offering initial free access and online courses. RTNN trains high-quality leaders in many ways. The annual Research Experience for Teachers takes place every summer and is aimed at continuing education for middle and high school teachers as well as community college instructors. Also during the summer is the Research Experience for Undergraduates, where selected students from all over the country participate in a 12-week program allowing them access to facilities and labs at NC State, Duke University, and UNC-Chapel Hill. In addition to its educational efforts, RTNN conducts social science research to improve user experiences and inform program development. The network’s commitment to engagement is evident in initiatives like the Community College Internship Program, which provides laboratory experience to community college students seeking to transfer to RTNN institutions. RTNN’s innovative programs and partnerships exemplify a commitment to democratizing university resources and advancing nanotechnology education and research. The Opal Mann Green Engagement and Scholarship Award recognizes RTNN’s exceptional contributions to the field and its dedication to fostering collaboration and accessibility in nanotechnology. ———— The annual Opal Green Awards will open for 2025 nominations later this year.

The finding was possible due to a new atomic force microscopy (AFM) method that measures the sub-nanoscale deformation rate in the material in response to changes in the material caused by energy storage. The researchers studied crystalline tungsten oxide dihydrate, which consists of crystalline tungsten oxide layers separated by atomically thin layers of water. The material is of interest because it holds promise for helping to store and release energy quickly and efficiently. However, it has not been clear what role the water plays in this process. To address this question, researchers from North Carolina State University, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) and Texas A&M University used a new methodology. The new technique relies on AFM to track the expansion and contraction of the material at the atomic scale and in real time as an electronic instrument called a potentiostat moves charge in and out of the material. This technique allowed the team to detect even minor deformations in the material as charge moved through it. “We tested both crystalline tungsten oxide dihydrate and crystalline tungsten oxide – which lacks the water layers,” says Veronica Augustyn, an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at NC State and corresponding author of a paper on the work. “And we found that the water layers appear to play a significant role in how the material responds mechanically to energy storage.” “Specifically, we found that the water layers do two things,” says Ruocun “John” Wang, a Ph.D. student in Augustyn’s lab and lead author of the paper. “One, the water layers minimize deformation, meaning that the material expands and contracts less as ions move in and out of the material when there are water layers. Two, the water layers make the deformation more reversible, meaning that the material returns to its original dimensions more easily.” “In practical terms, this means that the material with water layers is more efficient at storing charge, losing less energy,” Augustyn says. The paper, “Operando Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals Mechanics of Structural Water Driven Battery-to-Pseudocapacitor Transition,” is published in the journal ACS Nano. The paper was co-authored by James Mitchell and Shelby Boyd of NC State; Qiang Gao, Wan-Yu Tsai and Nina Balke of ORNL; and Matt Pharr of Texas A&M. The work was done with support from the National Science Foundation under grants 1653827 and 571800; an ORAU Ralph E. Powe Junior Faculty Enhancement Award, as well as support from the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, which is a DOE Office of Science User Facility and the Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport (FIRST) Center, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Basic Energy Sciences. -shipman- Note to Editors: The study abstract follows. “Operando Atomic Force Microscopy Reveals Mechanics of Structural Water Driven Battery-to-Pseudocapacitor Transition” Authors: Ruocun Wang, James B. Mitchell, Shelby Boyd and Veronica Augustyn, North Carolina State University; Qiang Gao, Wan-Yu Tsai and Nina Balke, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and Matt Pharr, Texas A&M University Published: May 16, ACS Nano DOI: 10.1021/acsnano.8b02273 Abstract: The presence of structural water in tungsten oxides leads to a transition in the energy storage mechanism from battery-type intercalation (limited by solid state diffusion) to pseudocapacitance (limited by surface kinetics). Here, we demonstrate that these electrochemical mechanisms are linked to the mechanical response of the materials during intercalation of protons and present a pathway to utilize the mechanical coupling for local studies of electrochemistry. Operando atomic force microscopy dilatometry is used to measure the deformation of redox-active energy storage materials and to link the local nanoscale deformation to the electrochemical redox process. This technique reveals that the local mechanical deformation of the hydrated tungsten oxide is smaller and more gradual than the anhydrous oxide and occurs without hysteresis during the intercalation and deintercalation processes. The ability of layered materials with confined structural water to minimize mechanical deformation likely contributes to their fast energy storage kinetics.

But what happens when these ions penetrate very small spaces? To address this question, researchers at NC State re-examined the behavior of a “classic” material, birnessite. Birnessite is a hydrated layered form of manganese oxide that can quickly store and release a variety of positive ions from electrolytes for many cycles. This makes it promising for use in high-power electrochemical energy storage, or in emerging electrochemical technologies such as desalination and rare element recovery from water. What’s more, it’s an abundant material, easy to make, and non-toxic. The mechanism by which birnessite can uptake and release cations has been described as both faradaic (involving charge-transfer) and non-faradaic (involving only electrostatic ion adsorption). To address this debate, the researchers used both experimental and computational approaches. “In the energy storage community, we normally think of charge storage as being either faradaic or non-faradaic,” says Shelby Boyd, first author of a paper on the work and a postdoctoral researcher at North Carolina State University. “At planar interfaces, faradaic refers to the specific adsorption of an ion to an electrode with corresponding charge transfer, as in a redox reaction. Non-faradaic refers to purely electrostatic adsorption without charge transfer. People have largely presented these mechanisms of charge storage as being mutually exclusive. But what we found with birnessite is that the nanoconfined interlayer structural water mitigates the interactions between intercalated cation and the birnessite. This results in an intermediate behavior from the two types of adsorption extremes at planar interfaces.” The researchers were also able to prove experimentally and theoretically that water in between the layers of birnessite is effectively serving as a buffer that makes capacitive behavior possible without causing significant structural change in the birnessite. Ultimately, the researchers say the findings highlight two future directions for the work, both of which are promising for the broader field of electrochemistry. “The field of electrochemistry is undergoing a renaissance,” says Veronica Augustyn, corresponding author of the paper and an assistant professor of materials science and engineering at NC State. “The ability to connect experimental results with atomistic-scale modeling of the electrochemical interface allows us to probe deeper than ever before and ask questions like: What roles are the solvent playing? What might happen when the reaction occurs under confinement? By understanding the capacitive mechanism of a material like birnessite, we set the stage for understanding more complex electrochemical reactions.” The paper, “Effects of Interlayer Confinement and Hydration on Capacitive Charge Storage in Birnessite,” is forthcoming from Nature Materials. The paper was co-authored by Saeed Saeed, a Ph.D. student at NC State; Karthik Ganeshan and Adri C.T. van Duin of Pennsylvania State University; Wan-Yu Tsai and Nina Balke of Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and Tao Wu and De-en Jiang of University of California, Riverside. Balke will join the NC State faculty as an associate professor of materials science and engineering in August 2021. This work was supported as part of the Fluid Interface Reactions, Structures and Transport, an Energy Frontier Research Center funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Basic Energy Sciences at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Boyd was also supported by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP). -shipman- Note to Editors: The study abstract follows. “Effects of Interlayer Confinement and Hydration on Capacitive Charge Storage in Birnessite” Authors: Shelby Boyd, Saeed Saeed and Veronica Augustyn, North Carolina State University; Karthik Ganeshan and Adri C.T. van Duin, Pennsylvania State University; Wan-Yu Tsai and Nina Balke, Oak Ridge National Laboratory; and Tao Wu and De-en Jiang, University of California, Riverside Published: August 2, Nature Materials DOI: 10.1038/s41563-021-01066-4 Abstract: Nanostructured birnessite exhibits high specific capacitance and nearly ideal capacitive behaviour in aqueous electrolytes, rendering it an important electrode material for low-cost, high-power energy storage devices. The mechanism of electrochemical capacitance in birnessite has been described as both Faradaic (involving redox) and non-Faradaic (involving only electrostatic interactions). To clarify the capacitive mechanism, we characterized birnessite’s response to applied potential using ex situ X-ray diffraction, electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance, in situ Raman spectroscopy and operando atomic force microscope dilatometry to provide a holistic understanding of its structural, gravimetric and mechanical responses. These observations are supported by atomic-scale simulations using density functional theory for the cation-intercalated structure of birnessite, ReaxFF reactive force field-based molecular dynamics and ReaxFF-based grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations on the dynamics at the birnessite–water–electrolyte interface. We show that capacitive charge storage in birnessite is governed by interlayer cation intercalation. We conclude that the intercalation appears capacitive due to the presence of nanoconfined interlayer structural water, which mediates the interaction between the intercalated cation and the birnessite host and leads to minimal structural changes.

Katie learned about MSE early: in high school. “Materials science and engineering was something I discovered in high school,” says Katie. “I have always liked understanding why things work on a fundamental level and chemistry was my favorite class. MSE seemed like a way to combine both into a study that applied to everything. I entered NC State with MSE intent and did my CODA in the winter of my first year. Once I was in the major, I found enjoyment in studying materials on the nanoscale; they seemed to break all the fundamental science rules I had learned so far.” Katie has been a key fixture in the MSE department since her first year, starting in spring 2019. “I became an undergraduate researcher in my second-semester first year under Dr. Cuomo. He was able to introduce the world of MSE research before my first MSE class,” says Katie. “There, I studied nanoparticle growth and logged many hours on the scanning electron microscope (SEM) in the undergraduate lab. I left Dr. Cuomo’s lab during my second semester a second year to study abroad at the University of Wollongong in Australia. My advisors at the time, Dr. Balik, Dr. Cuomo, and Dr. Yingling, assisted in rearranging my MSE courseload to accomplish this goal.” Learning that Australian university semesters begin in March instead of January, she had an extra-long holiday, being able to backpack in New Zealand and travel across Australia before class started. Katie Shaffer However, like so many of our graduating seniors, Katie felt the direct impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on her study abroad. “Two weeks into the class, COVID was declared a global pandemic, and everyone traveled home and resumed virtual studies,” says Katie “I still took my Australian classes via Zoom on their timezone from my parent’s basement in Bethesda, Maryland. The next semester, I joined Dr. Dickey’s lab for her final semester at NC State, where I assisted graduate students in grain boundary analysis,” shares Katie. In 2021, Katie was a PDP analytical chemistry intern with BASF in Wyandotte, Michigan, working in R&D analyzing microplastics. Initially assigned to work on water contamination, Katie had to pivot to extracting microplastics from sediment due to broken machines with her colleague, Jessie Garcia. This pivotal role shift enabled Katie to establish a method for deriving microplastics from sediment, and as a result, her first paper will be released soon. Katie is currently the first Undergraduate Researcher in Dr. Balke’s Research Group, where she works under Dr. Balke to study the piezoelectric properties of materials using atomic force microscopy (AFM). “This is fun for me. It looks like a lot of work, but I am fulfilled by it. I am not working a typical 9-5 job, but I am able to accomplish many things that I wouldn’t be able to do in other areas.” Katie confesses that her favorite professor is Dr. Jones. “It is very clear to the students how much time and energy he puts into developing his curriculum and teaching style. Even though my interest in his class topic was not as high as in other classes and it was 8:30 a.m., I looked forward to his class the most because he was such an engaging teacher,” shares Katie. On top of her schoolwork, Katie has served as the NC State MSE Lead Student Ambassador since fall 2020. This honor allows her to participate in and manage MSE student outreach events as well as educational videos for Open House. “That first semester I joined the MSE ambassadors in 2020 under Dr. Yingling, I created virtual programs using Zoom for current and incoming students who were unable to visit campus.” Katie’s favorite event with the ambassadors is the College of Engineering Open House. “This is where we get to do our fun live demonstrations that include liquid nitrogen and ferrofluid,” says Katie. “A hands-on approach has always been my favorite way of learning. It is no surprise then that my favorite classes were lab classes. The lab was a way to apply the fundamentals we learned in previous classes and an opportunity to learn characterization and analysis techniques.” And while the lab reports may not have been Katie’s favorite task when she was writing them on a Thursday night, they exponentially improved her technical writing skills, something she is very thankful for today. Katie’s favorite thing about MSE is how interdisciplinary it is. “Depending on what you study, you pull on physics, chemistry, biology, math, and many more disciplines,” says Katie. While there have been many victories along the way, she is most proud of her work to develop communities at NC State. “My goal while in leadership positions has always been to create more diverse and inclusive environments for students to shine,” says Katie. “Outside of MSE, I am president of NC State’s chapter of oSTEM, a national LGBT+ organization for students and professionals in STEM fields.” In her role, she facilitates workshops, industry chats, and community bonding activities. A great joy for Katie has been organizing oSTEM events over the past three years. Katie at her BASF internship (pictured with Jessie Garcia) During her time as a freshman at NC State, Katie volunteered with the WISE Village, as well as Girls Engineering Change, a program geared to middle and high schoolers that present challenges that younger kids can try to solve. A little-known truth about Katie is her passion for pre-K-12 STEM education. “I considered becoming a preschool teacher when I was in high school. I worked in aftercare after my high school classes and was a teacher for the summer program for 2 and 3-year-olds, where I taught kids to learn how to share, how to be a member of society, and to be curious about the world around them. While I ultimately decided that career was not for me, I still enjoy teaching all ages about STEM and MSE whenever I can,” says Katie. Katie at Symbio Wildlife Park in Helensburgh, NSW, Australia with some local grey kangaroos at their petting zoo For fun, Katie enjoys getting her vitamin D by being outside, whether it is hiking, sitting by a lake such as Lake Johnson, or traveling. “One fun fact is that I hiked up and down the Tongariro Crossing volcanic mountain range in New Zealand,” says Katie. After her spring 2022 graduation, Katie will begin graduate work on a Materials Science and Engineering Ph.D. at the University of California at Santa Barbara. She will pursue a career in materials characterization, a passion that has been developed through her experience in undergraduate research.

Graduate programs in veterinary medicine, nuclear engineering, and biological and agricultural engineering continued their dominance on the biennial list, ranking among the top 10 programs in their respective disciplines. The 2023 rankings are based on quality indicators such as student-faculty ratio, average GRE scores of incoming students and alumni success in the job market. They also rely heavily on peer assessments, giving significant weight to each school’s academic reputation. Moving Up NC State’s College of Education continued its steady rise in the rankings, moving up nine spots on this year’s list to rank 28th in the nation. That’s an impressive achievement, considering the college wasn’t even in the top 50 in 2017. What’s more, four of the college’s specialties ranked in the top 25 this year: education administration and supervision, 14th; secondary teacher education, 18th; elementary teacher education, 22nd; and curriculum and instruction, 24th. The College of Engineering, which slipped one spot to 26th in the nation, saw many of its specialties advance in the rankings. Biological and agricultural engineering, which it administers jointly with the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, moved up four spots to rank third in the nation. Mechanical engineering jumped eight spots to rank 38th and civil engineering moved up four spots to rank 26th. Several specialties moved up one spot this year, including chemical engineering, 20th; environmental engineering, 21st; materials science and engineering, 22nd; and electrical and electronic engineering, 34th. Nuclear engineering maintained its third-place ranking, which it first achieved in 2019. By the Numbers In the College of Sciences, statistics moved up five spots to rank 11th in the nation. And applied math made the list for the first time, ranking 21st in the nation. In the Poole College of Management, the part-time Jenkins MBA program recovered after losing ground in 2021 and is now ranked 57th in the nation — on par with its 2019 ranking. The College of Humanities and Social Sciences also had reason to cheer this year’s graduate school rankings. Its graduate program in nonprofit management moved into the top 25 nationwide, advancing two spots to 24th this year. And the graduate program in social work ranked 79th in the nation, up from 96th in 2021.
