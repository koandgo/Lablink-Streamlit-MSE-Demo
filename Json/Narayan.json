Aim of the present study was to see the effect of vitamin D on cognitive function in elderly. The study was conducted in Department of Physiology, King George’s Medical University (KGMU). A total of 80 subjects were enrolled based on Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score< 24 and vitamin D deficiency. They were divided into two groups as Group A (case) and Group B (control), each group having 40 subjects. Intervention (Vitamin D supplementation) was given in Group A. The assessment of dementia was done by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. Every subject was clinically evaluated and estimation of vitamin D was done by direct ELISA kit. Gender, weight, height, BMI, residence and education were also similar between two groups. A significant (p= 0.0001) change in MMSE score was observed in both Group A and Group B from baseline to 3 & 6 months and from 3 to 6 months, however, mean change was higher in Group A than Group B. In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation caused significant improvement in the cognitive performance in subjects with senile dementia.\nTotal citations\n20162017201820192020202120222023202420254397895311\nScholar articles\nAK Gangwar, A Rawat, S Tiwari, SC Tiwari, J Narayan… - Indian J Physiol Pharmacol, 2015"

Resistance exercise is strongly recommended for implementation in CVD prevention programs. Dynamic resistance exercise comprises of concentric (muscle shortening) and eccentric (muscle lengthening) phase. The contraction of skeletal muscle promotes the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and peptides from myocytes, known as ‘myokines’. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is the first myokine to be released in the blood in response to exercise.

However, most such studies have ignored the role of female sex hormones in influencing pain response across menstrual cycle (MC). In this study, we have investigated the variation in pain response on different days of the menstrual cycle. Ninety subjects (60 females) were subjected to experimental pain of cold pressor task, on days 1, 7, 14, and 21 of the MC (females), and on four consecutive Mondays of a month (males). Male subjects showed no variation in pain response. Females reported higher pain sensitivity on days 7 and 14 of MC. We suggest that experimental pain studies involving female menstruating subjects should be carried out only during a particular phase of the cycle, and this phase should be reported in literature to increase the reproducibility of the experiment.\nTotal citations\n2010201120122013201420152016201720182019202020212022202320241123321123\nScholar articles\nM Kumar, J Narayan, NS Verma, I Saxena - Indian J Physiol Pharmacol, 2010"

His work has led to novel functional materials such as supersaturated semiconductor alloys, metal–ceramic nanocomposites, laser-diffused solar cells, and the groundbreaking discoveries of Q-carbon and Q-BN—materials harder than diamond with record high-temperature superconductivity in B-doped Q-carbon.\nThese discoveries have influenced fields ranging from diamond and c-BN devices to high-efficiency Nano-Pocket LEDs for solid-state lighting, oxide electronics, multifunctional sensors, and nanomagnetics for information storage. For these achievements, Professor Narayan received the North Carolina Science Award, the state’s highest civilian honor, and was celebrated in The Chronicle of Higher Education as the “Michael Jordan of microelectronics” (2010) 【NC State News | Chronicle】.\nQ-Carbon and Q-BN\nThe discovery of Q-carbon and Q-BN, along with the conversion of carbon into diamond and h-BN into c-BN at ambient conditions, represents a breakthrough in the science of diamond-related materials. This journey began with seminal Science papers in 1979 and 1991 and culminated in a series of publications from 2015–2018, as well as ten U.S. patents and two international patents pending. These patents, licensed to Q-Carbon LLC, have fueled commercialization efforts. His work earned the 2017 and 2018 R&D-100 Awards for Q-carbon and diamond-related products.\nDomain Matching Epitaxy\nProfessor Narayan invented Domain Matching Epitaxy (DME), a paradigm for growing thin-film heterostructures across large lattice misfits by matching integral multiples of lattice planes. This innovation revolutionized the integration of oxides and nitrides on silicon and sapphire substrates, verified through synchrotron studies. His patents in DME and novel ZnMgO–ZnCdO materials have been licensed by industry leaders to advance high-efficiency solid-state lighting.\nEarlier Pioneering Work\nIn the late 1970s, Professor Narayan introduced laser annealing and solute trapping in semiconductors, which enabled the creation of supersaturated semiconductor alloys—the backbone of modern integrated circuits. For this work, he received the 1981 U.S. DOE Award, the 1983 IR-100 Award, and later the 2011 Acta Materialia Gold Medal for leadership in materials science. His solute trapping concept has influenced Nobel Prize–winning and Kyoto Prize–winning research in quasicrystals and alloy physics.\nEducation\nPh.D. Materials Science and Engineering University of California, Berkeley 1971 \nM.S.

As an example, hardness played a key role in the Stone Age to sustain human life. Today, hardness plays a critical role in protective coatings for applications ranging from microelectronics packaging to cutting tools needed for oil and gas extraction and high-speed machining. Materials with hardness greater than 20GPa are defined as hard, those with hardness greater than 40 GPa are considered superhard, and those greater than 70 GPa are ultra-hard. Diamond with hardness 70-100 GPa is considered ultra-hard, while c-BN with hardness of 50 GPa is considered superhard. The hardness is a function of bulk modulus and Poisson������������������s ratio, while it increases with increasing bulk modulus and number density of atoms in covalently bonded materials like diamond, but it decreases with increasing Poisson������������������s ratio. Diamond is well established hardest material, because it has the highest bulk modulus and the number density of atoms along with low value of Poisson������������������s ratio. Therefore, our challenge in designing ultra-hard material is to enhance bulk modulus and number density of atoms, and keep Poisson������������������s ratio to a minimum. Intellectual Merit: This proposal is based upon a major materials breakthrough, where amorphous carbon and nanocrystalline h-BN can be converted directly into diamond and c-BN by nanosecond laser melting and quenching. By controlling the degree of undercooling, we have created novel Q-carbon and Q-BN phases, which exhibit 30 to 70% higher hardness than diamond. There is also evidence of three distinct phases of Q1, Q2 and Q3 and B-doped QB1, QB2, and QB3 with varying hardness. This polyamorphism in amorphous Q-phases is remarkably analogous to polymorphism in crystalline phases. We propose to investigate fundamental mechanisms of hardness enhancement in different coatings on model sapphire and steel substrates, and correlate with atomic structures. The enhanced toughness is derived from amorphous structure of Q-phases and composite nature of diamond nanocrystallites often embedded in Q-carbon matrix. The enhancement in adhesion is derived from laser melting and interfacial reactions to the substrate. We propose to create novel Q-carbon, Q-carbon and nanodiamond composites, Q-BN, and diamond/c-BN layered structures to achieve Holy Grail of enhanced hardness, toughness, adhesion and oxidation resistance in nanocomposite coatings. We will perform detailed atomic structure and bonding characterizations and correlate with hardness, toughness, adhesion and wear characteristics to evaluate the performance for cutting tool coatings. Our extensive laser-solid interaction simulation will guide the processing challenges and create novel materials with improved properties. Broader Impact: We propose to integrate this research with curriculum development and related educational activities, such as MS Nano program. The conversion of ordinary carbon into new phase of Q-carbon and diamond solves a key challenge in reducing carbon footprint and sustaining the quality of life. Since this conversion occurs at ambient temperatures and pressures, there is a significant reduction in energy usage and scale-up processing of diamond and related materials and their structures. The proposal addresses training of graduate and undergraduate students in collaboration with ORNL, Kopin Corporation and NC A&T to attract minority students into the graduate program. The PI initiated a very successful ASM Materials Summer Camp, where high-school students are trained for a week on new materials and technologies. We utilize our strong international exchange program for students and faculty. Under the PI������������������s leadership, NCSU has launched an MS degree in Nanoengineering through its Engineering Online network, where students around the globe can finish their MS degrees in Nanoengineering. As a part of this\nDoping of Diamond and c-BN beyond Thermodynamic Solubility Limit for Solid State Devices \nDate: 09/28/17 - 9/27/20\nAmount: $290,000.00\nFunding Agencies: US Army - Army Research Office\nThis research program proposes a transformative approach to n- and p-doping of diamond and c-BN beyond the current state-of-the-art. The main concept is based on the recently discovered direct conversion of amorphous carbon into diamond and h-BN into c-BN at ambient temperatures and pressures in air in the form of large-area single-crystal films on substrates such as sapphire and silicon. The key advantage stems from the novel growth method, where the carbon layers are melted by using high-power nanosecond pulsed lasers in a highly super undercooled state, and then quenched rapidly either into a new state of carbon or into the single-crystal diamond phase in the presence of a template for diamond growth. Similarly, h-BN can be melted in a super undercooled state and converted into large-area single-crystal c-BN films. Accordingly, it is envisioned that dopant impurities present in the amorphous carbon and h-BN films can be incorporated into substitutional sites of diamond and c-BN during rapid liquid-phase crystallization via the phenomenon of solute trapping. As the proposed approach is a fundamentally nonequilibrium process, dopant concentrations in electrically active sites for both n- and p-types can far exceed the thermodynamic equilibrium solubility limits, while maintaining the energy levels, overcoming the long-standing challenge of diamond. Specifically, the feasibility studies on n-type doping (N, P, As and Sb dopants) will be carried out by incorporating these dopants into carbon by ion implantation, followed by rapid recrystallization from super undercooled state into epitaxial diamond thin film heterostructures. Similarly, n-type and p-type doping of c-BN will be achieved by Si and Zn dopants, respectively. The p-type (B dopants) doping of diamond will be accomplished by pulsed laser deposition of boron doped carbon layers at 500C in the presence of oxygen and hydrogen. Our preliminary results on nitrogen doping in diamond have already indicated that the dopant concentrations in electrically active substitutional sites can indeed be much beyond the thermodynamic solubility limits. Lattice location (substitutional versus interstitial) studies will be performed by using atomic resolution techniques and the results correlated with electrical activation and detailed carrier transport measurements. Theoretical calculations of dopant energy levels, ionization efficiencies, carrier concentrations and mobilities will be carried out in parallel to establish correlations with experimental results and to guide the fabrication of novel solid state devices. A primary goal of the combined effort is to demonstrate the p-n diodes of diamond and c-BN with satisfactory junction characteristics by controlling the dopant concentrations and the types vertically and/or laterally in the process. When successfully implemented, the proposed research is expected to revolutionize the doping and practical applications of diamond as well as the related materials such as c-BN. \nDirect Conversion of Carbon into Q-carbon and Diamond and Fabrication of Novel Nanostructures \nDate: 09/01/17 - 8/31/20\nAmount: $286,495.00\nFunding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF)\nOverview: We generate a lot of carbon through transportation, power generation and energy consumption. The reduction of carbon footprint in the US and the planet is the highest priority to sustain the quality of life for humankind. Since the graphite is the stable form of carbon, its conversion to diamond at ambient pressures and temperatures is against the equilibrium thermodynamics or the carbon phase diagram. According to the phase diagram it can be done only at very high pressures and temperatures (over 120,000Atm and 5000K). This proposal is based upon our recent discovery, where we showed that carbon can be converted directly into diamond at atmospheric pressure and ambient temperature in air. With the help of kinetics, we bypass thermodynamics and create new Q-carbon phase or diamond or a mixture of Q-carbon and diamond structures with exciting new properties. The primary focus of this proposal is to convert one of the most abundant materials into one of the most precious and useful materials in the form of Q-carbon and nanodiamonds across the scale for a variety of applications, ranging from diamond electronics and quantum computing to abrasives and coatings to biomedical devices Intellectual Merit: The primary objective of this proposal is to develop a fundamental understanding of basic mechanisms involved in the direct conversion of carbon into Q-carbon and/or diamond. The next step is to use this understanding to create novel diamond nanostructures with unique properties for a variety of applications. By using nanosecond pulsed laser irradiation, we propose to melt carbon in a super undercooled state at around 4000K (about 1000K below the melting point of carbon) and quench it into diamond or a new structure (distinct entropy), which is referred to as Q-carbon. This conversion into Q-carbon or diamond, which depends on the degree of undercooling will be investigated systematically as a function of laser and substrate parameters. The Q-carbon can also be converted into diamond by subsequent laser pulses. Atomic structure and bonding characteristics of Q-carbon will be studied and correlated with its unique properties, which include ferromagnetism with Curie temperature over 500K, extreme hardness (harder than diamond) and negative electron affinity. By controlling the nucleation and growth times, we can create novel nanostructures, ranging from nanodiamonds to large-area single-crystal films. The mechanism of formation of these single-crystal nanostructures will be investigated in detail, particularly their nucleation and growth characteristics and growth directions. The focus of this proposal is on synthesis and scale-up processing of pure and N-doped nanodiamonds (1-100nm of uniform size), microdiamonds (100-500nm) and microneedles (>2000nm) on crystalline sapphire and amorphous glass substrates, as needed for a variety of applications. This proposal expands our fundamental knowledge base on laser-solid interactions and transient thermal processing of materials, and on the critical role of structure, defects and chemistry in the properties of novel Q-carbon and diamond based nanostructures. Broader Impact: This discovery provides a very inexpensive and rapid way to convert carbon into useful diamond structures and harvest them conveniently for a variety of applications. Since this conversion occurs at ambient temperatures and pressures, there is a significant reduction in energy usage and scale-up processing of diamond and related materials and their structures. The proposed research will be integrated with four MSE graduate and undergraduate courses (MSE-760, 702, 465, 201 Honors) taught by the PI on Engineering Online Network. This proposal addresses training of graduate and undergraduate students in collaboration with ORNL, Kopin Corporation and NC A&T to attract minority students into the graduate program. The PI initiated a very successful ASM Materials Summer Camp, where high-school students are trained for a week on new materials and technologies.

The goal is to conduct a detailed investigation of defect behavior and interface structure in these oxide systems, in order to determine how these factors influence the resultant electronic and magnetic properties of the films and the cross coupling of electrical and magnetic fields within these structures. The focus of the research will be on conducting a detailed nanoscale characterization (with sub-angstrom reso1ution) of the atomic structure and chemistry of the heterostructures using a probe corrected FEI Titan 60-300 S/TEM with a complement of spectroscopy attachments. The primary motivation for this research program is to identify experimental approaches for achieving robust electrical switching of magnetic moments in these complex oxide heterostructures.\nGOALI: Novel Epitaxial Vanadium Oxide Thin Film Heterostructures Integrated with Si(100) \nDate: 07/01/13 - 6/30/19\nAmount: $595,766.00\nFunding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF)\nProject Summary For next-generation solid state devices, integration for functionality and rapid response will require epitaxial growth of exciting sensor materials such as VO2 on Si (100), which is a preferred substrate of a computer chip. Interesting modification of electrical, optical and magnetic properties of VO2 in a controlled way can further enhance the functionality of such silicon based heterostructures. Intellectual Merit: In this proposal, the focus is on epitaxial VO2 thin film heterostructures functionally integrated with Si(100), which is a big challenge because of the complex VO2 structure and tendency to form interfacial amorphous SiO2. This problem will be solved by using t-YSZ, c-YSZ, NiO/TiN and TiO2/TiN buffer layers to create VO2/t-YSZ or c-YSZ/Si(100), VO2/NiO/TiN/Si(100), and VO2/TiO2 /t-YSZ or c-YSZ/Si(100) heterostructures. Using these buffer layers in epitaxial structures, we propose to control strains and formation of transient M2 phase and transition directly to M1 phase and optimize SMT characteristics needed for device applications. Growth of VO2 rutile phase in these heterostructures involved epitaxy across the misfit scale which was made possible by our paradigm of domain matching epitaxy. In the DME paradigm, integral multiples of planes match across the film-substrate interface with a systematic variation of domains to accommodate entire misfit during growth. We propose to investigate the details of epitaxy in the rutile phase (above the semiconductor to metal transition of 680C) and during the transition into the monoclinic phase, and correlate the residual strains with the transition characteristics. We have discovered ferromagnetism at room-temperature with Curie temperature above 500K in the VO2 thin films due to process-induced intrinsic defects. Our preliminary studies have also shown that magnetic, optical and electrical properties of these systems can be controlled by pulsed laser irradiation, swift heavy ion irradiation, and controlled vacuum annealing. In each case, certain defects are introduced with interesting parallels. We propose to identify these defects and correlate them with systematic changes in electrical, optical and magnetic properties. Our eventual goal is to write (using laser and ion beams) these properties in a controlled way for novel device applications (smart infrared sensors, novel magnetic sensors, nonvolatile memory devices). To enhance the responsivity of microbolometers for smart infrared sensors, the Si(100) in the proposed heterostructures will be in the form of thin membranes, which will be processed for test device structures. Broader Impact: This proposal impacts profoundly on smart multifunctional magnetic sensors and IR camera integrated with silicon microelectronics, and creates a fundamental knowledge base on thin film epitaxy in complex systems and on the critical role of defects and chemistry in the characteristics of ultrafast phase transition and electrical, optical and magnetic properties. The proposal addresses training of graduate and undergraduate students, and collaborations with ORNL and Kopin Corp technology transfer and NC A&T and Shaw University to attract minority students into the graduate program at NCSU. The outreach will also involve ASM-International sponsored Summer School for rising High-School seniors, which PI initiated at NCSU five years ago, and now it has become an annual event. These students are exposed to recent developments in new materials, analysis tools, materials properties and modeling. The PI has an excellent record of research collaboration and supervision of graduate and undergraduate students with NC A&T and Shaw (minority) Universities. Under PI?s leadership, NCSU has launched MS in Nanoengineering through Engineering Online network, where students around the globe can finish their MS. As a part of this program, PI teaches a series of courses which students from NC A&T and Shaw can learn latest developments in thin film epitaxy, defect control, processing, characterization and modeling (see attached\nNovel Q-carbon Superconductors by Nonequilibrium Activation \nDate: 05/15/18 - 5/14/19\nAmount: $100,000.00\nFunding Agencies: Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)\n(1) This proposal is based upon our recent discovery of direct conversion of carbon into diamond or a new phase of Q-carbon at ambient temperature and pressure, where dopant concentrations can far exceed the Thermodynamic solubility limits. This novel nonequilibrium method will be used to create NV nanodiamonds, which are self-assembled and deterministically placed. These nanodiamonds will be epitaxially grown on (0001) sapphire substrate, so that all of them are exactly aligned with respect to each other. The size distribution and different placements for spin entanglement will be investigated systematically. (2) When molten carbon is quenched from a greater undercooling, we form a new phase of carbon, Q-carbon. This phase is ferromagnetic, when pure, but turns superconducting upon doping with boron. We have achieved highest BCS superconducting transition temperature of 57K at 25% at B concentration. By increasing the B concentration to 50 at%, we propose to achieve higher Tc. and explore interfaces of B-doped Q-carbon and topological insulators for Majorana Fermions. \nSusChEM: Direct Conversion of Carbon into Diamond and Useful Micro and Nanostructures \nDate: 08/01/16 - 7/31/18\nAmount: $80,000.00\nFunding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF)\nSusChEM: Direct Conversion of Carbon into Diamond and Useful Micro and Nanostructures: Overview: We generate a lot of carbon through transportation, power generation and energy consumption.

The formation of diamond single crystal microneedles will be investigated in detail, particularly their growth rates and growth directions. The undercooling needed to form the Q-carbon is a strong function of laser and substrate variables, which need to be controlled for various substrates. The Q-carbon has shown many exciting properties such as ferromagnetism with Curie temperature considerably higher than 300K. It has also shown enhanced field emission and very high hardness, both which will be investigated in detail and correlated with structure and bonding characteristics..

We propose to fully exploit topological insulator based structures for unique advantages over conventional semiconductor counterparts in optoelectronic applications. In particular, the magnetoelectric interaction at the topological insulator-magnetic layer interface and subsequent possibility of band engineering in the momentum space is the focus of investigation as they can facilitate judiciously tailored response to an optical signal, offering an ideal environment for realizing previously unattainable performances such as extreme sensitivity detection at room temperature. In a combined theoretical and experimental effort, the objective of this research program is to design, fabricate, analyze, and demonstrate the envisioned hybrid structures/devices with superior optoelectronic characteristics on a silicon compatible platform.\nDoping of Diamond beyond Thermodynamic Solubility Limit for Electronic Applications \nDate: 07/01/16 - 9/30/17\nAmount: $50,000.00\nFunding Agencies: US Army - Army Research Office\nDoping of Diamond beyond Thermodynamic Solubility Limit for Electronic Applications This research program proposes to exploit n- and p-doping of diamond based on the recently discovered direct conversion of amorphous carbon into diamond at ambient temperatures and pressures in air.

The oxides of interest are: ZnO dilute magnetic semiconductors (transition metal-doped), La-based manganate (half-metal), and BiFeO3 (a multiferroic). The research will address two major issues related to the epitaxial growth of magnetic oxides films. First, the research will continue studies to determine the mechanism for the ferromagnetism observed in transition-metal-doped ZnO (TM:ZnO). The second thrust will then focus on the epitaxial growth of (La,Sr)MnO3, BiFeO3 and TM:ZnO films on commercially ubiquitious sapphire (0001), Si(111) and Si(100) substrates, and investigate the formation of heterojunctions based on combinations of these oxides. This latter task will concentrate on the reduction of lattice-mismatch stress at heterojunctions and the reduction/passivation of defects (especially threading dislocations).

In India, very less percentages of its population donating blood. Therefore, the aims of our study was to study the anthropometric parameter and lipid profile in blood donors and rule out the body weight and BMI in psyche of blood donation.\nMethods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 165 healthy male blood donors. Physical parameters of donors were measured using standard protocol. After 350 ml of blood donation, 5 ml blood was collected in plain vial, total Cholesterol, TG, HDL, LDL, were estimated by reagent kit method. Results: Out of 165 subjects, 36% lies in the range of 50-60 kg whereas remaining 64% subjects were with weight of 60 to 70 kg. According to Body Mass Index only 38% have a BMI between 18.5 and 22.9 kg/m2 and remaining 62% subjects have BMI> 24 kg/m2\nConclusion: Female health should be taken into account to improve it. Strict screening should be done to check the general health status of the donors. We also concluded that BMI as well as waist circumference does not significantly relate with dyslipidemia."

  "text": "View article\nBackground: Systematic exercise is an essential component for health promotion and improvement of the quality of life. Exercise that emphasizes on the eccentric (lengthening) skeletal muscle contractions has recently gained attention due to its benefits over conventional exercise that predominantly involves concentric (shortening) muscle contractions. The mechanical efficiency of walking on an inclined (uphill) and a declined (downhill) treadmill is equivalent to those of concentric and eccentric muscle contraction, respectively. Objective: To compare the acute effect of uphill (concentric exercise) and downhill (eccentric exercise) treadmill walk on physical exertion and cardiovascular response. Materials and Methods: The present crossover study involved 30 males, aged 20.6±1.9 years, having a body mass index of 20.7±1.4 kg/m2. Participants did an acute bout of uphill (+ 0.16 grade) and downhill (− 0.16 grade) treadmill walk at an average speed of 4.6±0.4 km/h for 30 min. Borg’s 6-20 scale rating of perceived exertion (RPE), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), pulse pressure (PP), and rate pressure product (RPP) were the study parameters. Statistical analysis was done using paired t-test or\nWilcoxon test. Results: The downhill walk caused a significant (P< 0.05) lower mean change in SBP, HR, MAP, PP, RPP, and RPE (26.7±5.6, 58.2±6.8, 16.2±6.1, 15.9±4.1, 106.3±14.5, 12.5, respectively) as compared to uphill walk (22.3±6.0, 40.3±9.2, 12.53±6.7, 14.0±3.6, 74.6±15.7, 11, respectively).

The increased screen usage has been linked to deteriorating physiological and psychological well-being, contributing to physical inactivity, and a sedentary lifestyle, leading to serious health conditions such as obesity, depression, and disrupted sleep patterns. Medical students are particularly susceptible to these effects due to prolonged screen use, which compromises both their mental and physical health and increases the risk of addiction. This study aims to explore the impact of digital screen time on sleep quality, cardiometabolic health, and mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and stress among medical students.\nMethod: A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Department of Physiology, KGMU, Lucknow, involving 113 medical students. Data collection utilized a structured questionnaire alongside validated instruments: PSQI for sleep quality assessment, DASS21 for psychological distress evaluation, and SAS-SV for smartphone addiction screening. Results: The findings revealed that participants reported high average smartphone usage (8.84±10.62 years) and screen time (49.98±15.17 hours weekly). Statistical analysis demonstrated significant associations between smartphone dependency (p< 0.0001), psychological distress (p< 0.0001), and compromised sleep quality (Global PSQI score: 6.87±3.84) highlighting prevalence of disrupted circadian rhythms and compromised health.

  "text": "Independent Confirmation | Narayan Research Lab\nQ-carbon \nFerromagnetism: A 2018 article in Physical Review Materials theoretically investigated the intrinsic magnetism in Q-carbon. The study followed up on experimental reports from the time, which claimed that Q-carbon was a room-temperature ferromagnetic phase of carbon, potentially possessing a large magnetic moment (0.4μB0.4 mu sub cap B0.4𝜇𝐵/atom). The theoretical work was conducted to better understand the magnetic and structural characteristics of this amorphous form of carbon.\nSuperconductivity: The same 2018 theoretical study noted that Q-carbon exhibits superconductivity when doped with boron. This is believed to be due to the high proportion (75%–85%) of sp3s p cubed𝑠𝑝3-hybridized carbon atoms in Q-carbon, a property not found in typical amorphous carbon.\nHall effect: An earlier 2018 paper in ACS Applied Nano Materials described experiments on Q-carbon, reporting room-temperature ferromagnetism and an extraordinary Hall effect. The study used a range of techniques, including magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and SQUID magnetometry, to characterize the material and its properties. \nHeavy boron (B) doping \nSuperconducting properties: A key simulation study from May 2020, published in Physical Review Materials, focused on the effect of boron pairing on the stability of heavily boron-doped carbon. The simulations considered different allotropes with high boron concentrations (up to 25%) to understand their energetic stability. The findings indicated that boron pairing had a relatively small effect on the overall energetic stability.\nElectrocatalytic activity: Though slightly outside the 2018–2020 window, related work in 2021 and later demonstrated the positive effect of heavy boron doping on the electrocatalytic properties of carbon-based materials, including enhanced oxygen reduction reactions for producing hydrogen peroxide. These studies often combine experimental synthesis with Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations to understand the role of boron in modifying the electronic structure. \nMagnetism in carbon \nIntrinsic magnetism: Beyond the specific properties of Q-carbon, the 2018 theoretical paper in Physical Review Materials explored the general mechanisms for magnetism in amorphous carbon. This work contributed to the understanding of how magnetic moments and structural characteristics arise in disordered carbon systems.\nMagnetic composite materials: Research during this period also explored magnetism by combining carbon with other magnetic materials. A December 2018 paper discussed the development of magnetic carbon nanofibers by co-doping with boron and decorating with MnCo alloy nanoparticles for use in supercapacitors. Micromagnetic simulations were used in later work to analyze the magnetic properties of these composites."

The goal is to conduct a detailed investigation of defect behavior and interface structure in these oxide systems, in order to determine how these factors influence the resultant electronic and magnetic properties of the films and the cross coupling of electrical and magnetic fields within these structures. The focus of the research will be on conducting a detailed nanoscale characterization (with sub-angstrom reso1ution) of the atomic structure and chemistry of the heterostructures using a probe corrected FEI Titan 60-300 S/TEM with a complement of spectroscopy attachments. The primary motivation for this research program is to identify experimental approaches for achieving robust electrical switching of magnetic moments in these complex oxide heterostructures.\nOxide-Based Heterostructures and Devices \nDate: 01/15/10 - 7/14/15\nAmount: $443,895.00\nFunding Agencies: US Army - Army Research Office\nThe proposed research will seek to correlate the structural properties of complex magnetic oxide films and heterojunctions with their magnetic and electrical properties. The oxides of interest are: ZnO dilute magnetic semiconductors (transition metal-doped), La-based manganate (half-metal), and BiFeO3 (a multiferroic). The research will address two major issues related to the epitaxial growth of magnetic oxides films. First, the research will continue studies to determine the mechanism for the ferromagnetism observed in transition-metal-doped ZnO (TM:ZnO). The second thrust will then focus on the epitaxial growth of (La,Sr)MnO3, BiFeO3 and TM:ZnO films on commercially ubiquitious sapphire (0001), Si(111) and Si(100) substrates, and investigate the formation of heterojunctions based on combinations of these oxides. This latter task will concentrate on the reduction of lattice-mismatch stress at heterojunctions and the reduction/passivation of defects (especially threading dislocations). This research program will emphasize detailed nanoscale characterization (with a reso1ution 0.16nm) of the atomic structure and chemistry of the heterostructures using JEOL-2010(GIF) atomic resolution TEM with STEM-Z and EELS attachments and then correlate these findings with the resulting electrical and magnetic properties of the films. Ultimately, the findings will be applied to the fabrication and characterization of test structures with field tunable properties.\nView all grants"
