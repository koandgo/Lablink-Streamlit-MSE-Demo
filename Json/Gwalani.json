By combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium processing routes with high-throughput discovery techniques, the group explores how defects form, how materials degrade, and how these processes impact long-term performance. Their work spans sustainable and cost-effective manufacturing, alloy design for durability, and multi-scale characterization to unlock new pathways for high-performance structural and functional materials.\nSustainable Manufacturing\nWe focus on minimizing the environmental impact of metal processing by conserving energy and resources. Key strategies include energy efficiency, reducing waste, using clean technologies, and promoting eco-friendly product design.\nCost-Effective Manufacturing Routes\nOur manufacturing processes are designed for cost-efficiency and energy savings, focusing on microstructural modification and alloy composition through deformation-based processing techniques. We employ friction-assisted solid phase processing methods to produce non-equilibrium and compositionally graded alloys.\nRecycling Technologies\nOur method involves high-speed stirring of metallic scrap, which leads to frictional and adiabatic heating, followed by consolidative extrusion (Solid Stir Extrusion, SSE). This process allows us to create multi-material and multifunctional structures without bulk melting, providing an attractive solution for the eco-friendly recycling of complex waste streams and the advancement of advanced alloys/composites.\nAdvanced Alloys for Extremes\nOur manufacturing processes are designed for cost-efficiency and energy savings, focusing on microstructural modification and alloy composition through deformation-based processing techniques. We employ friction-assisted solid phase processing methods to produce non-equilibrium and compositionally graded alloys\nAlloy Design for Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Processing Routes\nDesign strategies include microstructural control by designing heat treatments for specific microstructural templates, composition selection informed by thermodynamic modeling, and heat treatment and thermomechanical processing cycles.\nHigh-Throughput Techniques for Material Discovery\nOur approach aims to create combinatorial material libraries, automated friction stir systems, In-situ monitoring, and characterization, and use Design of Experiments (DOE) for a comprehensive exploration of material and process space.\nBase alloy plate \nMulti-Scale Materials Characterization\nOur approach combines ex-situ and in-situ methods to observe materials at the mesoscopic to atomic scale in real-world conditions. We focus on dissecting the root causes of defect formation and the mechanisms behind material failure through comprehensive multi-scale characterization. Our expertise lies in devising tailored compositional and processing strategies to advance the development of future-oriented materials.\nProbing Materials at Multiple Length Scales\nThe multi-scale approach involves examining materials from the atomic and molecular level up to the macroscopic level, providing insights into how different length scales influence material characteristics.\nDiverse Testing Modalities\nWe conduct tensile, compressive, and shear tests under various temperatures and environments.\nNano-Scale Property Assessment\nOur use of precise, site-specific in situ testing methods enables us to evaluate localized properties meticulously.

An excellent combination of yield strength (~ 490 MPa), ultimate tensile strength (~ 850 MPa), and ductility (~ 45% elongation) was achieved by optimizing and coupling both strengthening mechanisms, resulting from a refined grain size as well as both L12 and B2 ordered precipitates.

Using Al0.3CoCrFeNi as a candidate HEA, this paper demonstrates the strong influence of thermo-mechanical processing on the transformation pathway adopted for isothermal second-phase precipitation. A traditional thermo-mechanical processing route comprised of homogenization cold-rolling solution treatment in the single fcc phase region, followed by a precipitation anneal at a lower temperature, results in a homogeneous distribution of nanometer scale-ordered L12 (gamma prime-like) precipitates within the fcc matrix. In contrast, if cold-rolling is followed directly by annealing at the precipitation temperature, then the resulting microstructural evolution pathway changes completely, with concurrent recrystallization of the matrix fcc grains and …\nScholar articles\nB Gwalani, S Gorsse, D Choudhuri, M Styles, Y Zheng… - Acta Materialia, 2018"

However, the L12 precipitates (stoichiometry of (Ni,Cr)3(Al,Fe,Co)) are de-stabilized and replaced by coarser B2 precipitates on annealing at 700 °C. Contrastingly, in the Co-free, Al0.3CuCrFeNi2 high entropy alloy, the L12 precipitates are stable at both 550 °C (~ 5 nm) and 700 °C (~ 50 nm), and exhibit a stoichiometry of (Ni,Cu)3(Al,Fe,Cr).

Phase inversion in crystalline solid systems is driven by the differences in elastic modulus of the two phases. Quenching from a high temperature single phase field, the RHEA exhibits a co-continuous mixture of a disordered BCC and an ordered B2 phase, that upon isothermal annealing at 600 °C develops via spinodal decomposition into a continuous B2 matrix with discrete cuboidal BCC precipitates aligned along the <001> directions. Longer term annealing at 600 °C results in the development of necking constrictions along the B2 channels, eventually pinching-off these channels and making the BCC phase continuous with discrete B2 precipitates.

We demonstrate that in a non-polar dipropyl ether (DPE)-based electrolyte solution with lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl) imide salt, the decomposition order of solvated species can be adjusted to promote the Li+/salt-derived anion clusters decomposition over free ether solvent molecules. This selective mechanism favors the formation of a robust cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI) and a solvent-deficient electric double-layer structure at the positive electrode interface.

The mechanical behavior of Al0.7CoCrFeNi with dual phase FCC+BCC microstructure has been compared with that of single phase FCC Al0.3CoCrFeNi. Both quasi-static and dynamic strain rate regimes were investigated. Hypo-eutectic Al0.7CoCrFeNi showed much higher strength due to fine lamellar microstructure with a large number of FCC-BCC interphase boundaries. But this also leads to lower strain rate sensitivity due to the long-range nature of these interfaces, overcoming them is indifferent with temperature elevation to assist slip, thus making them athermal barriers. Both these precipitation hardenable alloys were aged to induce precipitation of ordered L12 in the FCC phase. This coherent nano-scale L12 precipitate caused a significant increase in the yield strength of …\nScholar articles\nS Gangireddy, B Gwalani, V Soni, R Banerjee… - Materials Science and Engineering: A, 2019"

Incorporation of deformation twinning can overcome this limitation. An Al0.3CoCrFeNi high-entropy alloy was thermo-mechanically processed to yield a UFG triplex microstructure (davg: 0.71 ± 0.35 μm) with FCC, and hard B2 and sigma phases. The annealed material exhibited an exceptional strength-ductility combination with ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of ~1.1 GPa and elongation of ~25%. Furthermore, the alloy showed excellent fatigue resistance with an endurance limit of ~0.43 UTS. Remarkable mechanical properties are attributed to the formation of extensive deformation nanotwins and increased dislocation accumulation capability.\nScholar articles\nK Liu, M Komarasamy, B Gwalani, S Shukla, RS Mishra - Scripta Materialia, 2019"

However, the equilibrium phase-stability of these alloy systems is not well established. The present investigation focuses on the phase stability of Al0.5NbTa0.8Ti1.5V0.2Zr RHEA at temperatures ranging from 600 to 1200 °C. The detailed phase characterization involves coupling of scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and atom probe tomography. The stable phases present at these temperatures are (i) 1200 °C—body-centered cubic (BCC) matrix with nano-B2 precipitates; (ii) 1000 °C and 800 °C—a BCC matrix phase with Al–Zr rich hexagonal closed packed intermetallic precipitates and, (iii) 600 °C—a BCC + B2 microstructure, comprising a continuous BCC matrix with discrete B2 precipitates.

Both the alloys showed better wear performance in marine environment as compared to dry condition, indicating negative synergy of wear and corrosion. Al0.1CoCrFeNi was more wear resistant compared to CoCrFeMnNi in both environments. Accelerated electrochemical corrosion tests were carried out to quantify the effect of passive layer on marine wear behavior. Al0.1CoCrFeNi showed lower corrosion rate, higher pitting resistance and greater degree of passivation. A strong correlation was found between the electrochemical polarization resistance and wear resistance.\nScholar articles\nA Ayyagari, C Barthelemy, B Gwalani, R Banerjee… - Materials Chemistry and Physics, 2018"

Subsequently, a second solidification product forms, a disordered-bcc in case of x = 0.8 and a disordered-fcc in case of x = 1.0. Solid-state decomposition within these phases results in fcc + L12 and bcc + B2 products, accompanied by compositional partitioning. These results provide new insights into the influence of Al on the primary solidification product, and have been rationalized using a computational thermodynamic approach.\nScholar articles\nD Choudhuri, B Gwalani, S Gorsse, CV Mikler… - Scripta Materialia, 2017"
