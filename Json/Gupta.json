  "text": "View article\nDesigned materials offer noteworthy applications which are often architecture dependent. Despite knowing such a fact, one of the major challenges faced by the scientific community is to find ways to predict and, if possible, control the resultant architecture of a network. If such an exercise is fruitful, it creates enormous opportunities to synthesize exotic materials with tailor-made applications. Any network is composed of individual molecules and the transition from a single molecule to a network can be achieved through several routes taking advantage of synthetic chemistry. There exists a molecular building block at the heart of such a transition which mediates such a process from a single molecule to a network. Although a large number of building blocks have created assorted materials, utilization of a well-defined coordination complex as the building block (i.e., metalloligand) is unique for the construction of a …"

  "text": "View article\nAuthors\nRajeev Gupta, A. S. Borovik\nJournal\nJournal of the American Chemical Society\nDescription\nNon-heme manganese and iron complexes with terminal hydroxo or oxo ligands are proposed to mediate the transfer of hydrogen atoms in metalloproteins. To investigate this process in synthetic systems, the monomeric complexes [MIII/IIH31(OH)]-/2- and [MIIIH31(O)]2- have been prepared, where MIII/II = Mn and Fe and [H31]3- is the tripodal ligand, tris[(N‘-tert-butylureaylato)-N-ethyl)]aminato. These complexes have similar primary and secondary coordination spheres, which are enforced by [H31]3-.

Magnesium, the third most abundant metal, is the lightest of all structural metals and therefore has attracted significant attention for a number of industries including aerospace, automotive, and infrastructure applications. Magnesium alloys also possess excellent biocompatibility and support bone growth, and thus these alloys are also considered candidate materials for biomedical applications. The use of magnesium alloys in these applications, however, is limited but their poor resistance to environmental degradation and low strength. The ability to mitigate the corrosion of magnesium alloys while simultaneously increasing the strength could revolutionize the automotive and aerospace industries, as well as the field of biomaterials. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports research to understand the fundamental mechanisms of both strength and corrosion resistance in magnesium alloys, with the goal of providing unprecedented control over the properties and making it possible to tailor these materials for specific technical applications. The work also incorporates far-reaching educational and outreach objectives to inspire students in grades K-12 to purse education in STEM disciplines; to recruit, retain and support outstanding and diverse student groups at undergraduate and graduate levels; and to provide students the opportunities for active learning, mentorship, and scholarship related to this research areas. The outreach programs include research opportunities to high school students, working with the high school teachers to stimulate interests in STEM fields among young students and broaden participation of underrepresented groups. This research will contribute to the fundamental understanding of the properties of metastable nanocrystalline magnesium (Mg) alloys and the mechanisms that can enable high strength and corrosion resistant Mg alloys. Inspired by the phenomenon causing the \"stainless\" behavior in stainless steels, an innovative approach of improving mechanical strength and corrosion resistance of Mg alloys will be undertaken. The specific objectives of this research are to: 1) produce Mg alloys with a wide range of grain size, dispersion of intermetallics, and solid solubility of the alloying element; 2) study the influence of the nanocrystalline structure, the solid solubility of the metal alloying elements, and intermetallics on corrosion and mechanical properties; 3) identify the key mechanisms causing simultaneous improvement in corrosion and mechanical properties of magnesium alloys, and develop a theoretical framework for designing high strength corrosion resistant magnesium alloys.\nModified Feedstock for AM of Stainless Steel \nDate: 06/14/21 - 6/13/23\nAmount: $247,433.00\nFunding Agencies: US Navy - Office Of Naval Research\nWith a growing demand for higher complexity and efficient use of raw materials, additive manufacturing (AM), more commonly called 3D printing, has revolutionized manufacturing in both development and application. Net shape manufacturing, suitability to low volume production runs, efficient use of materials, and flexibility to produce nonconventional alloys are some of the advantages of AM. Developing new AM techniques and programs for printing complex geometries, optimizing AM parameters for productions of fully dense components, and studying the microstructure and mechanical properties have been the main focus of the research on AM. However, investigating the corrosion behavior of AM alloys has attracted only limited attention and significant discrepancy in the reported data exists. Defects and heterogeneities introduced during the AM process lead to inferior corrosion resistance in many instances. Most often post-processing is applied to eliminate the defects and improve the properties. The main objectives of the proposed research are to additively manufacture 316L stainless steel exhibiting high corrosion resistance and eliminate the need of post processing. Feedstock material for 316L will be modified using high-energy ball milling and suitable additives to achieve the proposed objectives. Homogeneity of the 316L feedstock will be improved by high-energy ball milling. Additionally, nitrogen enrichment of the feedstock, and dispersion of inhibitors and oxide particles in the feedstock material will also be achieved by high-energy ball milling. Additively manufactured 316L stainless steel produced by the modified feedstock material is expected to exhibit high corrosion resistance. Advanced electrochemical techniques in combination with the state-of-the-art surface characterization techniques will develop a mechanistic understanding of the corrosion behavior of the additively manufactured 316L. Deliverables of the project will be newly developed feedstock material to lead to high quality additively manufactured 316L stainless steel. The scientific understanding of the effect of feedstock modification on the microstructure and properties of the additively manufactured 316L stainless steel will be an additional benefit. The project will also have great educational and workforce development impacts. Graduate students working on the project will develop hands-on skills in using advanced experimental techniques and abilities to work on multidisciplinary projects. Outcomes of the project will also be beneficial in teaching and designing new courses on corrosion, manufacturing technologies, and alloy development.\nModification of Feedstock Material to Improve Corrosion Resistance of Additively Manufactured 316L Stainless Steel \nDate: 06/01/21 - 11/30/22\nAmount: $121,151.00\nFunding Agencies: US Navy - Office Of Naval Research\nThe main objectives of the proposed project are to additively manufacture 316L stainless steel exhibiting high corrosion resistance and eliminate the need of post processing. Feedstock material for 316L will be modified using high-energy ball milling and suitable additives to achieved the proposed objectives. Homogeneity of the 316L feedstock will be improved by high-energy ball milling.

The strength and durability of metallic materials is limited by the conventional compositions and manufacturing technologies. In particular, aluminum alloys suffer from corrosion susceptibility when subjected to processing techniques used to increase the strength of many alloys. The development of new aluminum alloys, with concurrent high strength and corrosion resistance, requires new scientific knowledge of the mechanisms that control corrosion and deformation behavior in these materials. This award supports fundamental research to uncover these mechanisms of degradation and strengthening. The investigation will also support the development of the knowledge base and workforce for the nation's future. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this research will be trained to address future technological challenges in a multidisciplinary setting. The outcomes of the research will help in developing teaching materials to support the nation's first undergraduate program in corrosion engineering at the University of Akron, and to support K-12 outreach activities to work with the local communities and high school students to increase STEM awareness. Use of aluminum (Al) alloys is limited in many applications due to their limited strength and deterioration of the corrosion performance with efforts made to increase their strength. Therefore, developing new Al alloys exhibiting ultra-high strength and excellent corrosion resistance is of paramount importance. It is hypothesized that grain refinement < 100 nm and extended solid solubility of Vanadium (V) in Al can improve mechanical and corrosion properties simultaneously. Nanocrystalline Al-V alloys with a wide range of V content will be produced using high-energy ball milling. The alloys will be exposed to various heat treatments for studying the thermal stability and creating a wide range of grain size, V solid solubility, and intermetallic distribution. The role of the microstructure on passivation, corrosion initiation and propagation processes, and mechanical properties will be studied using state-of-the-art material and surface characterization, electrochemical and mechanical testing techniques. This investigation will advance scientific understanding of the: 1) influence of the processing on the structure, corrosion and mechanical behavior of the nanostructured Al-V alloys, 2) role of nanocrystalline structure, intermetallics, and extended solid solubility of V on the corrosion and mechanical properties, and 3) phenomena leading to the simultaneous improvement in corrosion and mechanical properties. Fundamental understanding developed in this research will lead to a theoretical framework for the development of ultra-strong and corrosion resistant Al alloys. This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.\nLow Cost and Corrosion Resistant Compositionally Complex Alloys (CCA's) \nDate: 08/10/20 - 12/31/21\nAmount: $30,874.00\nFunding Agencies: US Navy - Office Of Naval Research\nPrinciple objective of the proposed project is to develop corrosion resistant CCAs using commodity metals. The corrosion resistance of developed CCAs will sought to be superior to 316L stainless steel, but at lower raw material cost. The alloys will be produced by arc melting and ball milling. The microstructure of the CCAs will be studied using advanced material characterization techniques. Corrosion behaviour will be tested and correlated with the microstructure.\nView all grants"

  "text": "Meet Rakesh Basu | Corrosion and Advanced Materials Laboratory\nHi there! My name is Rakesh Basu, and I am a 1st year PhD student in the Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) department at NC State University. My advisor is Dr Rajeev Gupta. I hail from Kolkata, West Bengal, India. I completed my bachelor’s degree in Metallurgy and Materials Engineering from the Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, IIEST Shibpur, in 2023 and moved to the US for my graduate studies. Currently, I am studying the corrosion behaviour, microstructure and mechanical properties in additively manufactured Cu-Ni alloys. Outside the lab, I try to stay active & enjoy going to the gym, hiking, and playing soccer. I love reading fiction, watching thriller movies and playing video games. I am a good cook and often spend my weekends trying to master culinary delicacies from around the globe. I’m deeply passionate about a career that lets me explore diverse domains, collaborate with people from various cultures & backgrounds, and eventually create my own business with the aim being “Explore, Connect, Innovate: Bettering the world one step at a time!”.\nWhat instruments are you using for your research and why do you like them?\nFor my research, I am using various characterisation instruments at AIF, namely the Rigaku SmartLab XRD, FESEM Hitachi SU8700, Keyence VKx1100, Bruker Hysitron TI980 Triboindenter & XPS. The XRD, SEM & Keyence come in handy for identifying manufacturing defects in my sample, different phases in my alloy, grain structure & their orientation, sites of corrosion initiation, etc. XPS, being a surface-sensitive technique, helps to explain the passive film characterisation & changes in the chemical composition of my alloy. As for my material’s mechanical behaviour, I primarily use the nanoindenter, which tells me about my alloy’s hardness & elastic modulus. Lastly, my sample preparation needs for SEM, EDS & EBSD are met by AIF’s materials sample preparation lab.\nWhat have you been researching?\nAdditive manufacturing (AM) is revolutionising the field of materials engineering by allowing the production of high-quality materials. These advancements are expected to further enhance Cu-Ni alloy’s already impressive corrosion resistance and strength. My preliminary research is focused on understanding the corrosion behaviour in 3D-printed Cu-Ni alloys and comparing them to their commercially available wrought counterparts. I expect to see better corrosion performance in my AM alloys. My main aim is to enhance the corrosion resistance and strength by improving the mechanical properties of the printed Cu-Ni alloys through feedstock modification. \n(A) Backscattered electron (BSE) image, (B) Higher magnification BSE SEM image of the as-printed melt pools along the z-direction, (C) Energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) maps of the as-printed Cu-Ni alloy perpendicular to the build direction. \nMaterials degradation, i.e., corrosion, is something we encounter everywhere, and it’s a process we can’t avoid. We spend billions each year trying to manage or slow it down. This becomes a significant problem in fields like construction, marine, and aerospace, dealing with structural materials. Imagine the disaster if an offshore oil rig, a high-speed train, or a skyscraper failed prematurely because of corrosion — it would mean loss of lives and resources. That’s why researchers are constantly developing new materials to improve corrosion resistance while ensuring they fit their intended applications. My research is about discovering the fundamental mechanisms and paving the way for designing high-strength, highly corrosion-resistant Cu-Ni alloys through additive manufacturing. It aims to enhance safety and durability, allowing the savings to be invested in nobler causes.\nWhat have you learned from your experience at AIF?\nAlthough I am still starting out, so far, I have learned how to independently operate several characterisation techniques to evaluate the structure, composition, and properties of my material and critically analyse the data and what it means in terms of the corrosion performance of my alloy. Also, by attending the XRD and SEM short courses, I was able to grasp the key fundamentals. I am grateful and will be using AIF’s world-class facilities for years to come.\nBest thing about AIF in 5 words or less?\nInnovative, cutting-edge & cooperative staff\nIs there a staff member at AIF that has helped you?\nAlthough everyone at AIF is kind, super helpful and amazing people, a special shoutout to Jenny, Chuck and Toby for their continued assistance throughout my 1st year.\nX-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the as-printed top and side surfaces along with the commercially available wrought Cu-Ni alloy."

  "text": "Senior Spotlight: Sofia Antinozzi | Corrosion and Advanced Materials Laboratory\nSofia pictured at the James B. Hunt Jr. Library, 2025. \nFrom Rocketry to Materials Science: Sofia Antinozzi’s NC State Journey\nSofia Antinozzi, a senior at NC State, has had an inspiring journey through Materials Science and Engineering (MSE). When she first entered college, Sofia wasn’t sure which engineering major to pursue, though she knew she wanted something chemistry-focused. “In high school, my most interesting and challenging class was chemistry, so I knew I wanted a chemistry-heavy major,” Sofia shares. “After experiencing MSE 201 with Dr. LaBean, I was hooked on the subject and decided to commit to MSE.”\nSofia’s time in the MSE department has been defined by both academic success and extracurricular involvement. She recalls her Thermodynamics class as a standout experience: “The content was fascinating, but the classroom environment was probably the most fun out of all the STEM classes I’ve taken at State,” she says. “It was a great mix of challenging material and a positive, engaging atmosphere.” This semester, Sofia is excited about her electives in composite and polymer processing, finding them both interesting and rewarding.\n“The content was fascinating, but the classroom environment was probably the most fun out of all the STEM classes I’ve taken at State. It was a great mix of challenging material and a positive, engaging atmosphere.”\nSofia Antinozzi ’25 on MSE Thermodynamics course\nIn addition to her academic pursuits, Sofia has contributed to NC State’s research community. During her undergraduate years, she worked in Dr. Gupta’s Advanced Materials and Corrosion Lab, focusing on corrosion patterns in additively manufactured steel. “I learned a lot about material degradation and the academic research process,” she says. “It was fascinating to understand the complexities of how materials break down and to contribute to such an important area of study.” This research experience solidified her interest in the field and led to her next step after graduation: working as an engineer for ExxonMobil, focusing on material degradation.\nBeyond her studies, Sofia has made a lasting impact through her leadership roles. As an officer for the Material Advantage Club for the past two years, she has helped the NC State chapter grow from a small group into a thriving organization. “When I first joined, we were a two-person club with almost no activities,” she recalls. “Now, we have a full team of members attending, presenting, and competing in MSE conferences. The growth has been incredible, and I’m so proud of what we’ve accomplished.” Dr. Gwalani, the club’s advisor, has been a huge supporter, and Sofia values the opportunity to lead such an engaged and passionate group.\nSofia has also played an active role in NC State’s High-Powered Rocketry Club, where she has served as an officer for three years. “Each year, our designs get more advanced, and we’re becoming more successful,” she says. “I love the STEM outreach and leadership aspects of the role, and the Huntsville competition is always a highlight.”\nOne of Sofia’s favorite things about being a part of NC State’s MSE program is the quality of guest speakers. “The department brings in amazing speakers every week, which keeps new ideas flowing,” she says. “It’s a fantastic resource for students, especially for those considering graduate school.”\nAs graduation approaches, Sofia reflects on her time at NC State with gratitude: “The experiences I’ve had here, both in the classroom and outside, have shaped who I am today. I’m excited to take everything I’ve learned into the next chapter of my career.”\nSofia under an Inukshuk in Whistler, Canada while visiting the 2010 Winter Olympics Grounds, 2023.

  "text": "Meet Venkata Bhuvaneswari Vukkum | Corrosion and Advanced Materials Laboratory\nI am Venkata B. Vukkum, a Ph.D. student in the Material Science and Engineering department at North Carolina State University. Currently I am in my third year and working with Dr. Rajeev Gupta. My Ph.D. research is to investigate and enhance the corrosion properties of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel via feedstock modification. \nI have a passion for research and teaching, so I want to see myself as a professor and independent researcher at the nation’s best universities. Apart from research, I am a fun person and enjoy socializing, gardening, singing, and sports, particularly badminton. \nWhat instruments are you using for your research and why do you like them?\nI have been using different characterization tools like Keyence surface profilometry, Zeiss XRCT, Rigaku XRD, Verios SEM, Hydra SEM – EBSD, Talos TEM, FIB, ToF-SIMS, and XPS. As a part of my research, I investigate, interpret, and compare the corrosion resistance of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel modified via feedstock modification where a specific element (Y, W, CNTs, etc) or compound (CrN, VN, CeO2, BN, etc) is incorporated using ball-milling. Corrosion data alone is insufficient to understand why the corrosion resistance is improved or deteriorated. Here is where visual interpretation is needed, and different characterization tools helped me to study them. For example, using Keyence surface profilometry, XRD, and XRCT, we can identify different phases and manufacturing defects in the specimen caused due to feedstock modification. The electron microscope aided in investing the microstructures where we could see the nanoscale oxide inclusions, dislocations, grain size and orientation, cellular structures, sub-cellular structures, and manufacturing defects. Surface-sensitive techniques like ToF-SIMS and XPS explain the passive film characteristics of the alloys. \nWhat have you been researching and how is it impacting the community?\n316L stainless steel alloy is widely used in various applications, from kitchenware to nuclear. Advanced manufacturing technologies like additive manufacturing has been booming due to their simplicity and ability to manufacture complex structure with precision. However, the properties of the printed component are inconsistent due to high solidification rates and heterogeneous microstructure. Corrosion of metallic alloys is inevitable, and globally US$4 trillion is invested in annual financial losses involving corrosion damage and protection. \nMy preliminary research is understanding and comparing the corrosion phenomena happening in additively manufactured stainless steel to conventional manufactured stainless steel. The main aim of my research is to enhance the corrosion resistance of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel, which was achieved by feedstock modification. By adding the step of feedstock modification, the corrosion resistance was significantly improved, and the next step would be moving this research lab scale to an industrial scale.\nMicrostructural characterization of additively manufactured (AM) composite powder containing 316L stainless steel and carbon nanotubes (CNT). The micrographs are captured using Talos TEM F200X \n“The main aim of my research is to enhance the corrosion resistance of additively manufactured 316L stainless steel, which was achieved by feedstock modification.”\nWhat have you learned from your experience at AIF?\nThe facilities at AIF are amazing.

  "text": "Meet Jijo Christudasjustus | Corrosion and Advanced Materials Laboratory\nI am a second year PhD student in the Materials Science and Engineering department and works under Dr. Rajeev Gupta. My ongoing project is to understand the corrosion mechanism of Aluminum alloy prepared by high energy ball milling technique. Since corrosion is a surface phenomenon, this work involves the characterization of surface and subsurface region, which is quite fascinating. You get to appreciate the corrosion phenomena at micron and atomic level using electron microscopes like SEM and TEM. Apart from my research world, I love to go to trails, explore yummy new dishes, and do some sketching in my leisure time.\nWhat instruments are you using for your research and why do you like them?\nIn my research, I use the Talos TEM, FIB, Verios SEM, Rigaku XRD, ToF-SIMS, and XPS. Electron microscopes reveal the stunning images of microstructure where I can understand the nanocrystalline grains, defects, passive film, dispersion of phases, corrosion initiation and much more. ToF-SIMS and XPS answer the modification in chemical composition on surfaces. Using a combination of these instruments will help me to reveal the fundamental mechanism causing the corrosion in Aluminum alloys.\nWhat have you been researching and how is it impacting the community?\nCorrosion in metals is seen everywhere around us, and it is an inevitable process. Billions of dollars are spent in either mitigating or delaying this phenomenon. It becomes a huge issue when the applications are related to constructions, marine, aerospace, etc., where the corrosion cannot be tolerated. Imagine a plane carrying many passengers or ship with cargo or a bridge and suddenly there is a premature failure in its components as a result of corrosion. It will be a disaster and loss of many lives and resources. Therefore, researchers are inventing novel materials to enhance the corrosion performance and simultaneously compatible to the application. My research is about discovering the fundamental mechanism to prevent premature failure and will help to open the design opportunities to produce high-strength and high corrosion resistant metal alloys.\nMy preliminary research is involved with understanding the factors causing the corrosion in conventional Aluminum alloys. The next stage is to figure out how an appropriate alloying element be introduced in it to enhance the performance of that alloy. The final stage involves examining the modification of microstructure and surface by the alloying element that will reveal the mechanism to prevent the corrosion. I have completed the second stage and the final stage is crucial that will answer the role of alloying element in providing the barrier required to inhibit the degradation.\nPitting corrosion on Al-V alloy caused by Fe-particle impurity where vanadium is covering the particle later to stop the further damage by reducing electrochemical potential difference. The image is obtained using the Talos TEM F200X G2.\nWhat have you learned from your experience at AIF?\nI have learned that we can project the overall picture of corrosion by the fragments of evidence obtained from different individual characterization instruments. AIF has also provided me with limitless resources and knowledge in understanding the basics and operation of instruments.\nBest thing about AIF in 5 words or less? \nPatient, knowledgeable and friendly staff\nIs there a staff member at AIF that has helped you?\nI approached Chuck, Fred, Elaine, and Chris for my research and they were super helpful and patient to accommodate my needs. AIF has excellent experts to guide the students in achieving the meaningful outcome from their research."
