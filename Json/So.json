Depending upon the materials and the device architectures used, the degradation mechanism can be very different. In this Progress Report, using examples in both small molecule and polymer OLEDs, the different degradation mechanisms in two types of devices are examined. Some of the extrinsic and intrinsic degradation mechanisms in OLEDs are reviewed, and recent work on degradation studies of both small‐molecule and polymer OLEDs is presented. For small‐molecule OLEDs, the operational degradation of exemplary fluorescent devices is dominated by chemical transformations in the vicinity of the recombination zone. The accumulation of degradation products results in coupled phenomena of luminance‐efficiency loss and operating‐voltage rise. For polymer OLEDs, it is shown how the charge‐transport and injection …\nScholar articles\nF So, D Kondakov - Advanced Materials, 2010"

Here we demonstrate an organic channel light-emitting transistor operating at low voltage, with low power dissipation, and high aperture ratio, in the three primary colors. The high level of performance is enabled by a single-wall carbon nanotube network source electrode that permits integration of the drive transistor and the light emitter into an efficient single stacked device. The performance demonstrated is comparable to that of polycrystalline-silicon backplane transistor-driven display pixels.\nScholar articles\nMA McCarthy, B Liu, EP Donoghue, I Kravchenko… - Science, 2011"

Stille polycondensation of a distannyl-DTG derivative with 1,3-dibromo-N-octyl-thienopyrrolodione (TPD) results in an alternating copolymer which displays light absorption extending to 735 nm, and a higher HOMO level than the analogous copolymer containing the commonly utilized dithienosilole (DTS) heterocycle. When polyDTG-TPD:PC70BM blends are utilized in inverted bulk heterojunction solar cells, the cells display average power conversion efficiencies of 7.3%, compared to 6.6% for the DTS-containing cells prepared in parallel under identical conditions. The performance enhancement is a result of a higher short-circuit current and fill factor in the DTG-containing cells, which comes at the cost of a slightly lower open circuit voltage than for the DTS-based cells.\nScholar articles\nCM Amb, S Chen, KR Graham, J Subbiah, CE Small… - Journal of the American Chemical Society, 2011"

Self‐emitting ability, transparency, true dark tone, and capability of being made flexible are some of the features of OLED displays, leading to a superior performance compared with liquid crystal displays. In addition to displays, OLEDs are also a strong candidate for lighting applications. Despite great advances in improving the internal quantum efficiency of an OLED to nearly 100%, the external quantum efficiency is still lacking behind due to optical losses. This review reports the latest advances in the optical design of OLEDs that address the external coupling efficiency of OLEDs. Discussed at first are the fundamentals of OLED optics and how the refractive indices of different layers in an OLED stack affect the extraction efficiency. Then, this paper reviews how microlens arrays, scattering layers, and …\nScholar articles\nA Salehi, X Fu, DH Shin, F So - Advanced Functional Materials, 2019"

  "text": "View article\nOrganic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) have been widely developed for flat-panel displays, but only recently the efficiency of white OLEDs has risen to the point where they can be considered for solid-state lighting (SSL) applications. In this review, we discuss the requirements of solid-state lighting as they relate to OLEDs. We focus on how the color, efficiency, and cost requirements of general illumination differ from those of displays and how these differences might have an impact on the design of organic SSL. We then present some recent developments in large-area fabrication techniques that might be appropriate for solid-state lighting applications. Finally, we review recent results in the development of organic materials, device architectures, light extraction schemes, and fabrication techniques that can lead to cost-effective OLED lighting."

We use poly [N, N′-bis (4-butylphenyl)-N, N′-bis (phenyl) benzidine](poly-TPD) as the HTL and electron blocking layer for the perovskite cells. In previous reports, poly-TPD was used as an HTL in vacuum deposited perovskite solar cells.[14] Here, the perovskite film was formed by sequential deposition of lead iodide (PbI 2) and methyl ammonium iodide (CH 3NH 3I). We found that the resulting film consisted of large crystallites with a complete coverage on the poly-TPD surface, and the average efficiency of the final devices reach a value of 13.8% and a maximum value as high as 15.3%. To deposit the perovskite film on the poly-TPD surface, a concentrated solution of PbI 2 was first spin-coated and then heated to partially evaporate the solvent and crystallize PbI 2. Subsequently, a dilute solution of CH 3NH 3I is spin-coated on top of the PbI 2 layer and CH 3NH 3PbI 3 is formed by interdiffusion of the precursors. As shown in Figure 1 b, a composite layer of spin-coated [6, 6]-phenyl-C 61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC 60BM), and thermally evaporated C 60 and 2, 9-dimethyl-4, 7-diphenyl-1, 10-phenanthroline (BCP) is deposited on top of the CH 3NH 3PbI 3 layer to planarize the surface of the perovskite layer, and to facilitate electron extraction and hole blocking.[17] More details on device fabrication can be found in the Experimental Section.

The individual layer thicknesses in the multilayer samples were varied from 10 to 200 Å. X‐ray diffraction and birefringence data show that there is a strong structural ordering in all layers, as well as across large spatial distances along the sample surface. Thus, the growth is ‘‘quasi‐epitaxial’’ even though the PTCDA and NTCDA crystal structures are incommensurate. From the optical absorption spectra, it was found that the lowest energy PTCDA singlet exciton line shifts to higher energy with decreasing layer thickness. Comparison of these results with a quantum mechanical model based on exciton confinement in the PTCDA …\nScholar articles\nFF So, SR Forrest, YQ Shi, WH Steier - Applied physics letters, 1990"

More recently, these materials are demonstrated as excellent gain media for laser applications due to their large absorption coefficient, low defect density, high charge carrier mobility, long carrier diffusion length, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and low Auger recombination rate. Despite the great progress in laser applications, the development of perovskite lasers is still in its infancy and the realization of electrically pumped lasers has not yet been demonstrated. To accelerate the development of perovskite‐based lasers, it is important to understand the fundamental photophysical characteristics of perovskite gain materials.

Both optical-absorption and time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a significant effect on the binding energy and the radiative recombination probability of excitons due to localization of carriers.
