Here, the prediction, synthesis, and multiscale characterization of 2D high‐entropy transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) alloys with four/five transition metals is reported. Of these, the electrochemical performance of a five‐component alloy with the highest configurational entropy, (MoWVNbTa)S2, is investigated for CO2 conversion to CO, revealing an excellent current density of 0.51 A cm−2 and a turnover frequency of 58.3 s−1 at ≈ −0.8 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. First‐principles calculations show that the superior CO2 electroreduction is due to a multi‐site catalysis wherein the atomic‐scale disorder optimizes the rate‐limiting step of CO desorption by facilitating isolated transition metal …"

Conventional EBM scan strategies and process parameters yield coarse columnar grains aligned parallel to the build direction. Through varying process parameters such as beam power, beam velocity, beam focus and scan strategy, the behaviour of the electron beam can be manipulated from a line source to a point source. The net effect of these variations is that the resulting crystallographic texture is controlled in a manner to produce either epitaxial deposits or fully equiaxed deposits. This research demonstrates the ability to change the crystallographic texture on the macroscale indicating that EBM technology can be used to create complex geometric components with both site-specific microstructures and material …\nScholar articles\nRR Dehoff, MM Kirka, FA List, KA Unocic, WJ Sames - Materials Science and Technology, 2015"

The treatment bath is composed of dilute hexafluorozirconic acid with small quantities of non-hazardous components containing Si and Cu. The corrosion resistance of treated steel was compared to samples treated in a phosphate conversion coating bath, in simple hexafluorozirconic acid and in TecTalis without the addition of the Cu-containing component. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the coating surface morphology, structure and composition. A Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) was used for studying film growth kinetics on thin films of pure Fe, Al and Zn. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) was performed on treated and painted steel for studying long-term corrosion performance of the coatings.

The film becomes thicker and more porous with increasing potential. It can rupture when potential is too positive in a non-corrosive Mg(OH)2 solution. Hydrogen evolution becomes more intensive as polarization potential increases, particularly when the potential at the film-covered Mg surface is close to or more positive than the hydrogen equilibrium potential, suggesting that an “anodic hydrogen evolution” (AHE) reaction occurs on the substrate Mg in film pores, and the significantly intensified AHE causes film rupture at high potential.\nScholar articles\nGL Song, KA Unocic - Corrosion science, 2015"

When coupled with the temporal differences between the start and end of a build, a top-to-bottom microstructure gradient forms. Characterized in this study is a microstructure gradient and associated tensile property gradient common to all EBM Inconel 718 builds, the extent of which is dependent on build geometry and the specifics of a build’s processing history. From the characteristic microstructure elements observed in EBM Inconel 718 material, the microstructure gradient can be classified into three distinct regions. Region 1 (top of a build) is comprised of a cored dendritic structure that includes carbides and Laves phase within the interdendritic regions. Region 2 is an intermediate transition zone characterized by a diffuse dendritic structure, dissolution of the Laves phase …\nScholar articles\nMM Kirka, KA Unocic, N Raghavan, F Medina… - Jom, 2016"

However, exposure to 5 wt% NaCl resulted in accelerated corrosion, with resultant SANS scattering changes detected. The SANS data indicated both particle and rough surface (internal and external) scattering, but with no preferential size features. The films formed in 5 wt% NaCl consisted of a thin, inner MgO-base layer, and a nano-porous and filamentous Mg (OH) 2 outer region tens of microns thick.

Fe-12Cr-5Al wt.% gas atomized powder was ball milled with Y2O3+FeO, Y2O3+ZrO2 or Y2O3+TiO2, and the resulting powders were extruded at 950 °C. The resulting fine grain structure, particularly for the Ti and Zr containing alloys, led to very high strength but limited ductility. Comparison with variants of commercial PM2000 (Fe-20Cr-5Al) highlighted the significant impact of the powder consolidation step on the alloy grain size and, therefore, on the alloy mechanical properties at T < 500 °C.

As chromia-forming alloys and Ni-containing alloys are both undesirable for this application, the focus has been on FeCrAl, although NiAl was used to evaluate the effect of steam oxidation at 1600°C for this study. For commercial and model FeCrAlY alloys, a critical Cr–Al composition was identified for 1 bar isothermal steam (100% H2O) oxidation resistance at 1200°C, which differed for exposures in Ar–50%H2O at the same temperature. Alloys with lower Cr and Al contents were not able to form a protective alumina scale under these conditions. To simulate the accident scenario, exposures were also conducted in steam with the temperature rising 5°C min−1 to 1500°C for the most oxidation resistant …\nScholar articles\nBA Pint, KA Unocic, KA Terrani - Materials at High Temperatures, 2015"

Wet waste is a low-cost, prevalent feedstock with the energy potential to displace over 20% of US jet fuel consumption; however, its complexity and high moisture typically relegates its use to methane production from anaerobic digestion. To overcome this, methanogenesis can be arrested during fermentation to instead produce C2 to C8 volatile fatty acids (VFA) for catalytic upgrading to SAF. Here, we evaluate the catalytic conversion of food waste–derived VFAs to produce n-paraffin SAF for near-term use as a 10 vol% blend for ASTM “Fast Track” qualification and produce a highly branched, isoparaffin VFA-SAF to increase the renewable blend limit. VFA ketonization models assessed the carbon chain length distributions …"

Using focussed ion beam it is possible to extract the samples from desired and very specific locations. The artefacts associated with this sample preparation method must also be fully understood. In this work, issues specifically relevant to the focussed ion beam milling of aluminium alloys are presented. After using the focussed ion beam as a sample preparation technique it is evident that gallium will concentrate in three areas of the sample: on the surface, on grain boundaries and at interphase boundaries. This work also shows that low‐energy Ar ion nanomilling is potentially quite effective for removing gallium implantation layers and gallium from the internal surfaces of aluminium thin foils.\nScholar articles\nKA Unocic, MJ Mills, GS Daehn - Journal of microscopy, 2010"

As expected, a synergistic effect was found between the Cr and Al contents to enable protective Al2O3 formation under these conditions.

These alloys exhibit promising mechanical properties but oxidation resistance in air with water vapor environments is currently limited to ~800 °C due to a transition from external protective alumina scale formation to internal oxidation of aluminum with increasing temperature. The oxidation behavior of a series of AFA alloys was systematically studied as a function of Cr, Si, Al, C, and B additions in an effort to provide a basis to increase the upper-temperature oxidation limit. Oxidation exposures were conducted in air with 10% water vapor environments from 800–1000 °C, with post oxidation characterization of the 900 °C exposed samples by electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), scanning and transmission electron microscopy, and photo-stimulated luminescence …\nScholar articles\nMP Brady, KA Unocic, MJ Lance, ML Santella… - Oxidation of metals, 2011"

A 12% Cr content alloy showed low mass losses in static Pb-Li at 700°C, where a LiAlO2 surface oxide formed and inhibited dissolution into the liquid metal. All the evaluated compositions formed a protective scale in steam at 1200°C, which is not possible with ODS FeCr alloys. However, most of the compositions were not protective at 1400°C, which is a general and somewhat surprising problem with ODS FeCrAl alloys that is still being studied.

While the carbon support offers high ethanol productivity, the MMO support yields enhanced C3+OH selectivity. MoKMMO-C, whereby Mo is initially contained on MMO then ground with carbon, behaves similar to the parent MoKMMO catalyst, as Mo on MMO has limited mobility during reaction. In contrast, on MoKC-MMO, significant Mo migrates from C to MMO during reaction, giving reactivity associated with Mo species on both supports (high C3+OH selectivity and productivity). MoS2 domain structures are correlated with the selectivity of the catalysts (C3+OH selectivity ∼ double MoS2 layers, total hydrocarbon selectivity ∼ single MoS2 layers).

To evaluate the candidacy of this system for directed energy deposition processes, single-line laser melts were made on cast Al-12Ce plates using three different beam velocities (100, 200, and 300 mm/min). The microstructure was evaluated in the as-melted and heat treated conditions (24 h at 300 °C). An extremely fine microstructure was observed within the melt pools, evolving from eutectic at the outer solid-liquid boundaries to a primary Al FCC dendritic/cellular structure nearer the melt-pool centerline. The observed microstructures were rationalized through the construction of a microstructure selection map for the Al-Ce binary system, which will be used to enable future alloy design. Interestingly, the heat treated samples exhibited no microstructural coarsening.\nScholar articles\nA Plotkowski, O Rios, N Sridharan, Z Sims, K Unocic… - Acta Materialia, 2017"

The electron beam melting (EBM) process is unique because the powder bed temperature can be elevated and maintained at temperatures over 1000 °C for the duration of the process. This results in three specific stages of microstructural phase evolution: (a) rapid cool down from the melting temperature to the process temperature, (b) extended hold at the process temperature, and (c) slow cool down to the room temperature.
