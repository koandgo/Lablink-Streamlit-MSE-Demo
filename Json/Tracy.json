Previous MALDI-TOF studies of Au nanoparticles using other matrices have encountered extensive fragmentation of nanoparticle as well as thiolate ligands. Absence of fragmentation enables precise determination of the distribution of mixed monolayer compositions on nanoparticles prepared by ligand exchange reactions and by synthesis using thiol mixtures. Reaction conditions producing mixed monolayers containing only one or a small number of usefully functional ligands can be readily identified.

  "text": "View article\nConversion chemistry is a rapidly maturing field, where chemical conversion of template nanoparticles (NPs) into new compositions is often accompanied by morphological changes, such as void formation. The principles and examples of three major classes of conversion chemical reactions are reviewed: the Kirkendall effect for metal NPs, galvanic exchange, and anion exchange, each of which can result in void formation in NPs. These reactions can be used to obtain complex structures that may not be attainable by other methods. During each kind of conversion chemical reaction, NPs undergo distinct chemical and morphological changes, and insights into the mechanisms of these reactions will allow for improved fine control and prediction of the structures of intermediates and products. Conversion of metal NPs into oxides, phosphides, sulphides, and selenides often occurs through the Kirkendall effect, where …"

Samples treated for 1−4 h at 200−500 °C show that the structures of the completely oxidized NPs do not depend on the temperature, but oxidation proceeds more quickly at elevated temperatures. For the Ni/NiO system, after formation of an initial NiO shell (of thickness ∼3 nm), single or multiple voids nucleate on the inner surface of the NiO shell, and the voids grow until conversion to NiO is complete. Differences in the void formation and growth processes cause size-dependent nanostructural evolution: For 9 and 26 nm NPs, a single void forms beneath the NiO shell, and the void grows by moving across the NP while conversion to NiO occurs opposite …\nScholar articles\nJG Railsback, AC Johnston-Peck, J Wang, JB Tracy - ACS nano, 2010"

The InAsxP1-x alloyed core has a graded internal composition with increasing arsenic content from the center to the edge of the dots. This compositional gradient results from two apparent effects: (1) the faster reaction kinetics of the phosphorus precursor compared to the arsenic precursor, and (2) a post-growth arsenic−phosphorus exchange reaction that increases the arsenic content. The cores have a zinc blend structure for all compositions and show tunable emission in the near-infrared (NIR) region. A first shell of InP leads to a red-shift and an increase in quantum yield. The final shell of ZnSe serves to stabilize the dots for applications in aqueous environments, including NIR biomedical fluorescence imaging.

  "text": "View article\nAuthors\nJessica A-C Liu, Jonathan H Gillen, Sumeet R Mishra, Emily E Evans, Joseph B Tracy\nPublisher\nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science\nDescription\nNew materials are advancing the field of soft robotics. Composite films of magnetic iron microparticles dispersed in a shape memory polymer matrix are demonstrated for reconfigurable, remotely actuated soft robots. The composite films simultaneously respond to magnetic fields and light. Temporary shapes obtained through combined magnetic actuation and photothermal heating can be locked by switching off the light and magnetic field. Subsequent illumination in the absence of the magnetic field drives recovery of the permanent shape. In cantilevers and flowers, multiple cycles of locking and unlocking are demonstrated.

The results expand the scope of analysis and reveal a rich chemistry of ionization behavior. ESI-MS of solutions of phenylethanethiolate monolayer-protected gold clusters (MPCs), Au25(SC2Ph)18, containing alkali metal acetate salts (MOAc) produce spectra in which, for Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+ acetates, the dominant species are MAu25(SC2Ph)182+ and M2Au25(SC2Ph)182+. Li+ acetates caused ligand loss. This method was extended to the analysis of Au25 MPCs with mixed monolayers, where thiophenolate (−SPh), hexanethiolate (−SC6), or biotinylated (−S−PEG−biotin) ligands had been introduced by ligand exchange.

They are also potentially applicable in magnetic recording media. In this paper, we report a systematic investigation of the magnetic properties of colloidal Co NPs after three extents of oxidation. The native sample has a thin (1.0 nm) CoO shell and exhibits no exchange biasing. The purposefully partially oxidized sample has a thicker CoO shell (3.2 nm), and is exchange biased. The sample fully oxidized to CoO loses exchange biasing. We observe three distinct magnetic properties that result from the finite-thickness antiferromagnet shell exchange coupled to a finite-size ferromagnet core, and from crystal and stoichiometric defects: (1) an enhancement of the thermal stability of the orientation of the magnetic moment due to exchange biasing in the partially oxidized sample, (2) a low-temperature …\nScholar articles\nJB Tracy, DN Weiss, DP Dinega, MG Bawendi - Physical Review B—Condensed Matter and Materials …, 2005"

In response to new CEMRI guidelines, the team deliberately designed its research and educational activities to emphasize both advances in fundamental materials science and enhanced materials innovation and translation. Intellectual Merit. Understanding, harnessing and exploitation of dynamic processes related to the aggregation of multicomponent particulate materials, and the conformational changes of macromolecular assemblies and networks represent significant current frontiers in materials research. �����CEMRI has assembled three teams of leading researchers in materials theory, synthesis, processing and applications to establish the �����CEMRI. IRG1: Multicomponent Colloidal Assembly by Comprehensive Interaction Design. The goal of IRG1 is to develop a fundamental understanding of self-assembly of bulk materials from multi-component colloidal suspensions. Bidisperse colloidal suspensions are ideal experimental models of complex materials, such as ionic crystals and binary alloys. These structures have potential for application in photonic, electronic, and biomedical devices and are more highly tunable than single component colloidal systems. The rich phase behavior expected in multi-component systems of multi-faced particles, multipolar particles, and particles with different geometric structures (rods, nonspherical shapes) will allow for advancement both of fundamental materials science and the development of novel applications. IRG2: Genetically Encoded Morphodynamic Polymers. In Nature, peptide polymers represent the largest class of dynamic macromolecules that perform innumerable functions. IRG2 will focus on understanding and harnessing the behavior of genetically-engineered, biologically-inspired peptide-based macromolecules that exhibit critical and reversible inter- and intra-molecular noncovalent interactions. Genetic encoding allows precise control of chemical functionality, sequence, stereochemistry, molecular weight, and thus, environmental sensitivity and supramolecular assembly. IRG2 will develop a broad range of new stimuli-responsive molecules, ?Genetically Encoded Morphodynamic Polymers? (GEMPs), develop understanding of how block copolymers that incorporate these molecules in random and programmed ways behave, and use block copolymers in forming new hierarchical and hybrid functional materials. IRG2 will focus explicitly on studying fundamental phenomena and systems that have been heretofore difficult to access through conventional polymer synthesis. IRG3: Advanced Silicone-based Bulk and Interfacial Constructs. Silicone elastomer networks (SENs) are used in myriad settings today (from bathroom fixtures to nanofabrication facilities) and have thus been extensively studied. The palette of network and surface chemistries commonly available in such versatile materials remains, however, very limited. This IRG will develop and implement new functional SENs (FSENs) that allow versatile and independent control of bulk network properties and surface properties. Such control is vital for application of SENs in a number of emerging applications, including those where it is necessary to utilize the solubility and transport properties\nCAREER: Magnetic Field-Driven Self-Assembly of Magnetic and Multifunctional Nanochains in Bulk Matrices \nDate: 03/01/11 - 2/28/17\nAmount: $550,000.00\nFunding Agencies: National Science Foundation (NSF)\nWe propose to investigate the field-driven assembly of magnetic nanoparticle chains in polymers and to characterize the novel, nanostructured nanoparticle-polymer composites that result from this process. The assembly of magnetic nanoparticle chains in polymers is largely unexplored, and this proposal aims to gain understanding and control over the chain assembly process and to characterize the properties of polymer composites containing magnetic nanoparticle chains.\nDevelopment of a Method for In Situ Nanorheology of Human Airway Mucus \nDate: 08/01/12 - 6/30/15\nAmount: $122,466.00\nFunding Agencies: National Institutes of Health (NIH)\nThe ability to monitor viscoelasticity of airway mucus in situ may lead to new methods for assessing the efficacy of therapy, for drug delivery, and for the construction of better biophysical models of mucociliary clearance. We propose to develop an emerging nanorheological imaging technology based upon dynamic light scattering of plasmonic gold nanorods, in combination with an optical coherence tomography imaging platform.\nView all grants \nHonors and Awards\n2022 - Fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry (FRSC)\n2017 - Humboldt Research Fellowship Programme for Experienced Researchers\n2015 - University Faculty Scholar\n2014 - Alcoa Foundation Engineering Research Achievement Award\n2011 - NSF CAREER Award"

Here, nanostructural control of mixed-phase Ni2P/Ni12P5 (represented as NixPy) NPs prepared through the thermolysis of nickel acetylacetonate using trioctylphosphine (TOP) as a ligand and phosphorus precursor is reported. The P:Ni molar ratio controls the NP size and is the key factor in determining the nanostructure. For P:Ni molar ratios of 1−3, nickel NPs form below 240 °C and subsequently convert to crystalline-hollow NixPy NPs at 300 °C. For higher P:Ni ratios, a Ni-TOP complex forms that requires higher temperatures for NP growth, thus favoring direct formation of NixPy rather than nickel.

This report is closely related to two recent studies by the group of SH Sun: in one study, amine-stabilized Ag (core)/Au (shell) NPs were synthesized and then annealed to form AuAg alloy NPs.[34] In another study, AuAg alloy NPs were synthesized through simultaneous reduction of gold and silver salts.[15] In our two-step method, amine-stabilized Au NPs were first prepared through digestive ripening using dodecylamine (DDA) in refluxing toluene under inert atmosphere to improve their monodispersity.[54, 55] A solution of silver acetate (AgOAc) dissolved in toluene and DDA was then added, and refluxing was continued for growing the Ag shells. The amount of AgOAc added controlled the stoichiometry of the Au (core)/Ag (shell) NPs. The Au (core)/Ag (shell) NPs were then isolated and annealed in oleylamine (OLA) at 250 C for transformation to AuAg alloy NPs. The one-step method skips the Au (core)/Ag (shell) structure by transferring the Au seeds to a solution of AgOAc in OLA and annealing at 250 C. The SPR absorbance of the alloys can be tuned by adjusting the Au: Ag molar ratio of the precursors, which controls the composition. These alloys may also have potentially useful catalytic properties, and amines can be removed more easily than thiols, which are permanent catalyst poisons and were not used in this synthesis. Other amine chain lengths for ripening and growth of the Ag shells were explored, but shorter chains caused …\nScholar articles\nMS Shore, J Wang, AC Johnston‐Peck, AL Oldenburg… - Small, 2011"

Independently controlling the AR and size of GNRs remains challenging but is important because the scattering intensity strongly depends on the GNR size. Here, we report a secondary (seeded) growth procedure, wherein continuous addition of ascorbic acid (AA) to a stirring solution of GNRs, stabilized by cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and synthesized by a common GNR growth procedure, deposits the remaining (∼70%) of the Au precursor onto the GNRs. The growth phase of GNR synthesis is often performed without stirring, since stirring has been believed to reduce the yield of rod-shaped nanoparticles, but we report that stirring coupled with continuous addition of AA during secondary growth allows improved control over the AR and size of GNRs.
